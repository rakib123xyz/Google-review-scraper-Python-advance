São Camilo Hospital,"Av. Pompéia, 1178 - Pompeia, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",PATRICIA SZSENTES TEIXIERA,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a day ago,"A welcoming hospital. Both child and adult care. The nurses are attentive and cautious and the doctors clarify your doubts and are punctual.What bothers me, it always takes a long time to be attended to, Pompéia unit.Even though the demand is a large number of patients, they should review it to make care faster, especially in the PS."

São Camilo Hospital,"Av. Pompéia, 1178 - Pompeia, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Guilherme “Gomes”,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",2 days ago,"São Camilo Hospital… A bastion of health in São Paulo, where I have been cut (literally) in surgeries, where my wife has fought battles in the ICU and where I have paraded countless times in orthopedics in just one year.Medicine? Cutting edge. The screening? Impeccable. The pros? Angels in lab coats. But… oh, the ticket window!This is where the surrealism of Brazilian bureaucracy finds its apotheosis. The setting? A mosaic of exhausted faces, passwords that never flash on the panel and a rhythm that would make even a turtle stop for a cup of coffee. Would a hospital of this size, with the level of excellence you have, be beaten at the start by a ticket window? It's almost poetic. Or tragic. It depends on the point of view.The experience of waiting for a ticket at São Camilo is practically a forced meditation on the fragility of life. It's an existential test, a reminder that while the heart beats, the system operates in its own time. It's not a wait; it is an initiation. A rite of passage. And, honestly, it's a lack of care that doesn't match the perfection you deliver in all other aspects. Thank you, ANS.Suggestion to the governing body: How about an anthropological experience? Break a leg. Literally. Or tear a ligament, face a panic attack or, who knows, a mysterious rise in blood pressure. But, before throwing yourself into the welcoming arms of professionals, try to survive the odyssey at the ticket window. It's a guaranteed epiphany. Life takes on another dimension when you realize that your biggest rival at the hospital is… a password.And, if the issue is parking, I would just like to say one thing: Estapar should be banned in São Paulo. There is nothing more to say.Finally, reinforcement: Saint Camilo, you are giants. But please, prove your greatness in the basics as well. Hire more people for the counters. Because no patient deserves to have their life put on hold while the panel decides to spin."
São Camilo Hospital,"Av. Pompéia, 1178 - Pompeia, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Daiara Martins,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",4 days ago,"Service from both the reception and the doctor was terrible.Everyone was very rude, I arrived half an hour before my appointment, it was already past my appointment time and they hadn't called my password yet, when suddenly I heard my name being called, when I went it was the Doctor. She asked if I had already been to reception. I said no and she said that if I didn't come by immediately I would lose my appointment, when I spoke to the receptionist she said that it was my problem, that she couldn't do anything as they were late, I stood until the person who was there came out and I said I would only leave when they made mine form, as I had traveled far and would not miss the appointment. Then I went into the doctor's room and for her to be a mackerel, the only thing missing was the horseshoe, extremely rude and rude, I left there crying. Feeling terrible."

I went with my 10-day-old son because it seemed like he was breathing badly. When I got there, the doctor evaluated him in 3 MINUTES and diagnosed him with bronchiolitis, saying he needed hospitalization.After more than 2 hours waiting for admission, in the observation room with no doctor providing care, we decided to leave.At another hospital, the doctor who evaluated him said he had absolutely NOTHING.In other words, in addition to the doctor being terrible and not knowing how to give a diagnosis, there is also the fact that he requests an unnecessary hospitalization for a 10-day-old newborn. Leaving the baby really exposed to other diseases.Worst hospital, we will never go back."

Terrible experience, clinic, now the hospital structure, food without schedule, lunch that came with puree with a piece of plastic and a hair in the middle, the experience was absurd, I insisted on paying a little more in the agreement to have São Camilo da Pompeii, but I say, avoid this hospital, which is bankrupt."

Then it seems that all hospitals are horrible.That said, I had extremely positive experiences, both when I passed the PS (general and ortho) and the pediatric PS. The service at the pediatrics was quick, the girls collecting the exams were super patient and agile, the results even came out in less time than estimated and the treatment was correct. This refers to our visit in October 2024.Previously in December 2022, my baby was admitted to the pediatric ICU with sepsis and, considering the sadness of the situation, we had an excellent experience. I am very grateful to Hospital São Camilo Pompeia and I trust them with my life without thinking twice."

Dr. Hugo asked for an X-ray of the ankle, leg and hip, said nothing happened and recommended pain medication. I explained to him that my son was feeling pain and couldn't put his foot on the floor. His response was: if it doesn't improve, come back here later.It is worth mentioning that he neither assessed nor touched my son. As a result, I went to another hospital, and in the same X-ray as Doctor Hugo didn't see anything, the doctor at the other hospital found that my son had a fracture in his leg.IT'S ABSURD, terrible service.

I've been to the medical center a few times, and once again I tried to give a vote of confidence, but for once I was disappointed! Discontent ranges from reception to medical care. When scheduling my appointment, the attendant said that I could go earlier, that way the doctor would see me and it was good for her, that she would leave early too.I had an appointment scheduled with orthopedist Vanessa, I arrived at reception at 2:01 pm, got the password and waited to be called. To my surprise, people who arrived later at reception were served first, even with a password!  When I questioned that several passwords were being answered beforehand, I was told that it was just like that, that I should wait and that my password would only be called close to the appointment time! Obviously I did not accept, and requested that my file be opened, with some dissatisfaction I was answered.Ok, time to wait for the appointment, I sat waiting for two hours, the doctor saw some patients who were there before (so far ok), but she sat for a long time with the room empty without seeing anyone and even went out to have a coffee according to the rules. attendants passed me by! They only came to see me close to the scheduled time, after having their coffee, although they could have helped me sooner, yes, I was unoccupied in the room for a long time! The bad service doesn't end there, amazingly the consultation took 5 minutes, she barely examined it, requested an exam, gave me medication and asked me to start physiotherapy without the results of the exam! He treated me as if he were doing me a great favor, within five minutes he gave his opinion on what he thought was happening and ended the consultation. São Camilo and his employees are getting worse and worse! If you need to see outpatient doctors, I suggest not using the São Camilo medical center, it's getting worse every day!"

I spent 2 hours waiting to be “called”. After long hours waiting to take the medicine I went to speak to the nurse who said “you will have to wait another hour”…Note: totally unstructured logistics, they were not following the order of numbers, nor priorities... worst of all are the nurses themselves joking among themselves that one was in the other's department there... and others in the small room playing on their cell phones...

I stayed in the hospital with my son from the 02/07 until the 06th and I had great care in the room accompanied by a great nurse, including the nurse ""Daiana"" who, God bless you, always helped me a lot during those days when I was monitoring my son's hospitalization. , on the day my son was discharged, I was alone with him at the time and Daiana was generous enough to accompany me to the car carrying my baby's bag.

I was waiting for more than 40 minutes, when I was surprised by a call from the hospital asking where I was as the doctor had called me a few times. He said he was in the hall waiting and the panel hadn't called me. What happened, the doctor was on the first floor and not on the second, ABSURD.- Emergency room ALWAYS crowded and waiting hours (for children and adults)- My wife went to the ER today and the doctor who attended to her didn't even look at her face the entire appointment. Based on the description of the symptoms (hip), the doctor already started medication without doing any type of exam and said, if the symptoms don't go away within 24 hours, you should go back. Oops, what do you mean? Medication without examination, apparently they just want to provide more care and take money from the insurance plan with consultations.SAINT CAMILO IS DECAYING"

Since my last visit, São Camilo hospital has changed a lot, for the better, investing in infrastructure, renovating several areas, expanding and segmenting the triage area, reception (includes card opening), signage and medical waiting area. it was very good. In relation to service, we noticed a very significant improvement, employees were more polite, courteous and less stressed. As incredible as it may seem, I was also surprised by the length of service (total, between screening, opening the form, consultation at the doctor's office, exams, return with the doctor and release), this is because we noticed that there were enough people to pass the screening, even so , the internal waiting areas, were ""relatively empty"", more organized and better distributed. I want to give a special compliment to Dr. MARIA SUMAIA DIAS MADY, who provided my care, made a point of explaining calmly and in a very didactic way, the entire process of diagnosis, clinical and analysis of exam results, as well as the treatment , everything down to the smallest details, in no rush to let me go.I am very satisfied with São Camilo's response, as I understand that my past complaint contributed in some way to the improvements that were applied in practice and is currently generating positive results, in a very significant way.Congratulations, São Camilo, Congratulations, Dr. Maria Sumaia Dias Mady, you are making a difference!Hugs,"

The doctor approved an external diet due to feeding problems, but the hospital doesn't allow them to heat the food, which doesn't help, unfortunately unprepared people, my daughter with PCR at 106, and everyone talking about being discharged, if it weren't for the ENT to assess the her condition, she would not have stayed on the medication for 7 days. I received a document where they presented to me what was not covered by the agreement, I requested an ointment that came after more than 6 hours and the hospital always informed me that the amount would be paid separately, as if we didn't know and I even received a call in the room and a charged by the head nurse on the day of discharge, for a miserable 19.30 on my last day, they asked me to change rooms, to help another mother, and they took me to a room with a broken bed, and accommodation for the companion uncomfortable, and worn out, I felt like they didn't care about my well-being and that of my daughter, I'm 8 months pregnant. Anyway, I realize that the hospital does not treat patients well and does not focus on finding out if there is something else that causes the disease or symptoms, if the nursing professional does not enter your room and you pass through the corridor, they do not say good morning, super unfriendly! with the exception of Dr. Georgia, and the head nurse who attended to me on the last night, and the assistants Camila, Leo and another guy, I don't remember his name, he was from the night shift and attended to me one night, Maria and Natalia, who were exceptional, attentive and human, these I can exclude from my complaints, the others in my opinion should not work in healthcare as they have no empathy at all.

I started having severe abdominal pain at one in the morning at the hotel due to kidney stones, a known problem, but this time it came with an intensity I hadn't had before!I arrived at the hospital this morning at 3:20 am. My triage was quick with a friendly nurse, who did the bureaucratic work they need to do, but quickly and empathetically! He immediately took me to the medication room, I chose to walk despite the difficulty and slowness because sitting down made the pain worse! I was received by other nurses who attended to me, welcomed me, guided me, and said that despite my pain, which was visibly disturbing, they told me that I needed to wait for a medical evaluation before being medicated, which is the correct course of action! I sat down in a lot of pain, a little clumsy, and within a few minutes I was seen by a young, friendly and objective doctor regarding my situation. We talked, she medicated me, requested tests, and I remained under observation throughout the morning in the most comfortable way possible for a 10 out of 10 pain patient, sitting in an emergency room chair. In the morning, I was re-evaluated by another doctor, a little older, but equally charismatic and decisive. He informed me about the stone, its location after the tomography, contacted the urology team, and decided to admit me for surgery on the same day as my pain did not subside even with a few doses of morphine. I spent the whole morning under another observation. , for more or less 6-7 hours until I was admitted, but always with people asking me how I was, medicating me, taking care of me. Away from home and alone about to undergo surgery! I went up to my room at 2:30 pm. I went to the surgical suite at 3:30 pm, after getting ready, taking a shower and changing. Standard procedures for this surgery in this hospital. I spoke to the anesthesia team and was instructed on how the anesthesia would be performed, before during and after the procedure. I spoke to the surgeon, for the first time for more than a minute, as the emergency room was busier and there wasn't much time. I explained my situation of being from afar and he was ready to give me written instructions so that I wouldn't have any problems post-operatively. We went into the operating room. Once again guided, questioned so that there are no mistakes in identity; name, date of birth, which side is the disease! Simple questions that avoid big problems when asked systematically. Everything was fine during the surgery and in the immediate post-operative period. I went down to the room, with a friendly and careful stretcher bearer. I had dinner and had a snack right after, after all I had been fasting for 24 hours, besides, I love hospital food!I'm fine, no pain, fed, nice room and wonderful people!I could be complaining about every thing that needs to be done in a large hospital like this so that mistakes are not made, but which “take up” our time. I could be complaining about the delay because I was in a busy emergency room, with a high demand from many different patients, with different illnesses, who also need care, care, affection, support, as I also needed and received!But I paid attention to every positive fact of each employee who served me. Ana Paula, Ricardo, Letícia, Fernando, Caíque, Adriano, Bruna, among many others whose names escaped me that day, the doormen when I went to pick up an order outside so as not to be without a cell phone, the girls in the kitchen and cleaning the board, They helped me eat and turned on the air conditioning for me.“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder!” We need to focus our attention on what is good!I have nothing to complain about this hospital, and I am very grateful for the assistance I received from each person who crossed my path here today!My sincere THANK YOU to everyone!"

Seriously, 2 hours in the morning, 6 hours have already passed between care, medication and exams, and I'm still here waiting to see the Dr. again to evaluate the results of the exams.It's a lack of respect not to have organization to speed up service, and my insurance doesn't even ask for any type of authorization!I saw people who arrived much later being seen earlier, not to mention a girl who had a password 6 numbers after mine, and went through the reception and doctor first as she probably knew a nurse, who took the paper from reception and took it to her to sign. and soon after the doctor called. This is unacceptable! The hospital was great, but the quality has dropped more and more.I say this as a priority because my father went to the ER 3 times in January with fatigue and they said it was a virus, and the last time they hospitalized him because it was a heart problem!They need to improve not only the medical team but also the service logistics to be faster."
São Camilo Hospital,"Av. Pompéia, 1178 - Pompeia, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Nat Saviatto,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",7 months ago,"If you have autistic relatives, never take them to this place. The São Camilo network does not have a special password for patients on the spectrum.  As if not having a priority password wasn't enough, when we tell the care team that the patient is autistic they are dismissive, they get very nervous, they think it's a lie, even though psychiatric proof has been presented. They treat you with contempt and when you explain the patient's situation they start to speak loudly and stretch their words as if the patient were deaf, which makes the patient's situation even worse. If the team had training, they would know that it is much worse to speak loudly and be dismissive of the situation. Clearly the hospital does not have a protocol adopted for this type of situation and it is regrettable because it was always very good, unfortunately the quality has dropped.I filed a complaint with SAC and was well attended to, they regretted what happened and said they would report it but I need to complain publicly so that people know that it is not a place prepared for this."

I would like to understand whether an x-ray that, according to the doctor, did not show significance for pneumonia is enough to send the patient home, who has asthmatic bronchitis, and complains that for 4 days he has had difficulty breathing despite using medications used during attacks (predisim 40mg and Aerolin spray 2 puffs every 4 hours)? Not to mention the information: ""we are not doing inhalation in the ER""... In 3 days, I will probably go back to diagnose pneumonia and prescribe antibiotics.Question: is the problem the doctors, most of whom are new, or the hospital?"

Last month a doctor prescribed me two different types of anti-inflammatories to be taken together (another doctor informed me that this could not have happened).I learned that there was a cost cut where all doctors were replaced by doctors who agreed to earn less.Doctors themselves are complaining about the reduction in scale.At 2AM there were 40 open files to be seen and only 3 doctors. When we questioned the waiting time, they said there was nothing to do, a minimum of 3h30 to be seen.There is a sign saying that there has been an increase in demand and that is why care is taking longer, however, if you already know about this increase, you should put more doctors on duty!Complete disrespect for patients who spend more than 4 hours with pain and fever!Not to mention those who need to take medication.

WORST HOSPITAL IN SP!!The doctor forgot to send my form to the medication department. I waited an hour and a half with a fever of 38° and was cold. After I went to the doctor, she realized she had forgotten. After that I was diagnosed with severe acute hepatitis and needed to be hospitalized for further tests.The doctor told me I could go home to get some hospital clothes.I went home and when I came back, I went through the entire entry process again, which took a long time and I spent more than 2 hours waiting to go up to my room. After waiting for so long, a nurse came to tell me that the admission had been canceled because the doctor shouldn't have said I could leave. Then I had to do the entire entry process 3 times on the same day. I arrived at the hospital at 11 am and was only admitted at midnight. 13 hours of waiting with fever and cold. Apart from the clearly unprepared nurses, when it came time to take my blood, it hurt too much and they couldn't find my vein. I'm a blood donor, I've never had problems with needles, my veins are easy to find, but this time they really did something wrong and it hurt a lot. It felt like my arm was on fire. I will never go back to this rubbish hospital again. I pay a fortune for health insurance to avoid being tortured. Terrible service from the doctor on duty as well. The room's bathroom was poorly cleaned. I asked to be discharged without the doctor's consent so as not to continue to be treated so badly. I hope that whoever helped me is treated like I was one day so they can feel what they do to others. Bunch of incompetents."

After a long 40 minutes of torture, the nurse managed to find the vein to perform the collection. We waited another 2 hours for the test results to come out... finally, both tests were negative and the second doctor who carried out the re-evaluation said it was nothing and did not prescribe any medication or give us any guidance. My daughter remained with a high fever, coupled with a lack of appetite and weakness in her body for three days.

My 7 month old baby, tired, crying, intense early morning for us. When examined, nurses with zero preparation for child care. They couldn't find the vein, they said it was because it moved, obviously babies will move. That's because I held her, and she was screaming, but she couldn't move her arm. Even so, without finding the vein, they pierced my daughter, her arm was so thin. Even I, who am not a nurse, saw that the hole was not in the correct position. It is impossible to understand how a hospital is in such a situation, it was super empty of patients, but with no professionals to work. Making children and babies wait and suffer for free due to lack of staff. In addition to the fact that they push covid tests because insurance plans do not cover it for babies, even without the child having respiratory symptoms. That super uncomfortable exam for nothing, just to make money. Dreadful experience. I DO NOT RECOMMEND! I traumatized my baby! And I'm still here, waiting for an employee to show up so I can find my daughter's vein, I've been waiting for 3 hours.

Despite the screening and registration being relatively quick, medical care was surprisingly slow. I have used SUS several times in my life and the service time and concern for the patient are MUCH higher than that of this hospital.As I said, in a week of outbreak, only THREE doctors attending. There were around 50 people waiting. Very neglectful.Another interesting thing: when I arrive to take my form and start the care circuit, an attendant approaches me and says: we have a 2-3 hour wait for medical care. I looked at her without understanding: and what option do I have? Was it a hint that the other emergency rooms in the region are better prepared or was it just to try to discourage me from joining? I haven't reached a conclusion yet.Ultimately, there is a great deal of regionalism with this emergency room.

We arrived at the Children's PS, and the first call took 1 hour. At the moment she had no fever because she took medicine at home to lower it, so she received the green bracelet. The doctor evaluated her and said it was best to have a specialist look at her. I was sent to adult PS hell... in this case, the call is pure luck. I was informed that the doctor would call by name and here I have been for over an hour and nothing.Now, if I had known or been advised from the beginning that she would need a specialist, I would have come to the ADULT PS with her. Another thing, why don't they have a specialist doctor for the child?Honestly, the service is deplorable! No respect, no humanity. People standing because there is no place to sit, people complaining at the nursing desk because it takes so long and the girls at the desk look like landscapes...Anyway!

São Camilo Hospital,"Av. Pompéia, 1178 - Pompeia, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Simonetani Tanii,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",9 months ago,"Today I arrived at São Camilo Pompéia with my 12 year old son. He came in as an emergency because he couldn't walk. We were taken to the observation room. He was seen quickly by an excellent doctor named Andreia who confirmed my suspicion: Myositis. She requested blood tests to find out if there was a need for hospitalization and prescribed saline solution with dipyrone for hydration and pain. Only one companion is allowed within the observation sector. There is a sign at the entrance! After waiting for a long time, I checked with the nursing staff to see if the collection would take too long and I already informed them of the problem my son had when collecting the sample (he has very thin veins and the person needs to be very skilled in this puncture). Then a nursing technician came and started the ""collection"". Of course, she did not have the requested skill. He was looking for my son's vein with the jelco (needle). I immediately told her to stop. She didn't stop! I told her once again to stop otherwise I would have to call someone responsible for the sector. Then she stopped. I asked a nurse to come and collect it (thinking she would have more skill). It came to this. He punctured it and couldn't do it either. I asked her to call someone from Neonatal. During this entire period of tension, due to the fact that our son was in pain due to his health condition and the lack of dexterity of these two people, there was a couple with a child next to our bed. This couple never stopped talking loudly and on the phone resolving personal situations with a financial institution. The time we stayed there, my son couldn't even relax because of how much chatter these two were making during an observation. Nobody stopped this couple. Not even the nurses who were there, much less the security guards. A hospital values ​​itself on the premise of silence, convalescence, respect! Well, when the third nurse arrived to try to collect my son's exam, I told her to ask the other companion who was there to leave. Which was already making me nervous with all the commotion and talk. Even my son was feeling uncomfortable too. She did nothing. So, I turned to the boy (I was next to my son, leaning against the curtain holding his hand) and asked him to kindly leave, as he couldn't be there, since the permission of one companion is for everyone and he He was already bothering me too much with his calls and loud conversations. Then his wife, who was sitting in the armchair behind me, began to swear at me. Telling me to shut up... a barrage of insults, which I have debated up until then but without using the same words. Then the unfortunate woman slapped me on my arm. Logically I defended myself with the same slap. Then the husband came on top of me to hit me. Calling me horrible names and threatening to kill me. Do you know what the employees did? Nothing! Only after I started filming did they call security. The guy was a real scoundrel with his insults and threats. Do you know what happened to my son??? He started to feel sick... crying compulsively and having a panic attack because he saw his mother being threatened by a coward! The omission of problems with the São Camilo network is extensive but nothing is done. But now it will be different because I will take legal action. There are cameras in the sector we were in and everything is recorded. Wait for me. Oh, what about my son? It was another terrible professional ""Dr Patrícia"" who discharged a boy whose CPK test was 7 times higher than it should have been. Running the risk of having kidney damage. And now????"

My veins are thin and not large, due to the daily use of morphine and as a result it punctures one day and the next it no longer reflows and I have to do another puncture and this one is very difficult.One day, I was stung 11 times and they were unable to do so.

I waited around 50 minutes and no one called me, which surprised me as there weren't many children to be attended to. I decided to contact the reception again to see what was happening, at that time another receptionist was there and he informed me that it was another place where I would be seen by the orthopedist and called a nurse to accompany me. I was outraged! They made me wait almost an hour in the wrong place.When the orthopedic doctor saw me, she told me that she had already called me 3 times!I went to orthopedics and she requested an x-ray of my daughter's forearm. I went downstairs and spoke to the receptionist who asked for my daughter's name and told me to wait “on the other side behind the wall”. I was on the right side waiting “behind a wall” and no one called me, I contacted her again and she instructed me to wait in the same place again. I was simply in the same room as her, after half a wall, she saw me all the time and only after about 20 minutes did she tell me that I was in the wrong place, that it was “behind another wall”. Anyway, there were two inconveniences that wasted my time. You need to provide better guidance to professionals, including improving signs and indications of where we should wait. I wasted around 1:30 of time waiting in the wrong places!As for the service provided by other professionals, everything was ok. My complaint is regarding the reception and orientation process at the location."

Whenever the Nutritionist asks for information and is given it, the kitchen does not observe or follow it. Lack of variety in dishes and the quality of food presented leave something better to be desired.Another subject is about the cleaning done, in the ICU cleaning is done from above, I have never seen anyone clean under the bed and at the bottom of it.

Not to mention that it took almost 40 minutes to take the medication and she was dying in pain and the nurse didn't want to let me stay with her. It's obvious that I didn't let it!! You need to understand that they are still children, they only have size... Therefore, they should receive differentiated care, have some priority. They stay together with adults who are having a really bad time, sometimes screaming, they are super scared. You need to review this concept of service. At Sabará hospital, child care is up to 17 years old, which is correct!! Not to mention that the doctors and nurses treat them very rudely. The service we received was terrible..."

I left the medication room looking for a doctor who could help me. It was when Dr. Ana Lúcia saw me and, then, I began to receive assistance with a request for tests (which should have been requested at the first consultation) and snacks.Summary: I arrived at PS 11 a little in the morning, I have the password, and I left almost 7pm at night When! When I complained that it was taking a long time for a doctor to see me because I was feeling unwell, in the medication room, a nurse shouted whether I thought I had a doctor available to me."

Detail: everything empty.The triage service was quick and the nurse knew how to handle the situation, sending me straight to the medication room, which was empty while my husband opened my file. The doctor took 30 minutes to see me, and in that time the nurses didn't even offer me any water, and I was in front of them shaking, short of breath, tachycardia and crying in panic. Loud TV just playing misery, the nurses chatting about when they were going to take time off and take vacations while I, who pays more than a thousand reais a month in Medical Insurance, without adequate treatment for the situation I was in.On the other hand, the doctor treated me very well, within the panic crisis protocols and I left there medicated and with the crisis under control."

There was a change of doctors at night. Excellent late afternoon doctor! The doctor who took her place, whose name is Diego (Room 4). Terrible! It seemed like he didn't want to work. When I was in pain, he was dismissive, wanting to release me with a prescription for medication without even looking me in the face, informing me that there was nothing different in the tests. I had to be stern saying that someone would solve my problem there and that only then would I leave. Anyway, he informed me that he was going to admit me, with a threatening tone... wow, he's a terrible professional!Hospitalization Experience:Excellent by the way. The service was excellent from the assistants, nurses and doctors on standby to assess and investigate what I had considering my symptoms. I had nothing to complain about this period and the professionals involved. Nursing Assistants: Maira and Helder are very good and careful. Excellent professionals. Different from PS treatment."

Good hospital but the PS leaves a lot to be desired, no one should expose their health to risk, we were admitted to the PS at 10:10pm and left at 5:30am, I asked about the delay, the first girl said I would be the eighth person to be answered, as the hours passed I asked again, I had already changed the shift so my name wasn't even on the list!!😯🤦🏼‍♀️Lack of organization and responsibility towards the patient 😡"

The quality has plummeted absurdly. I arrived on a Sunday at 6:30 am with my wife in severe pain... we were the only ones in the waiting room and we waited for 1:10 to be called only after I complained. Upon entering the room, the doctor, looking like he was sleeping, said he thought she had already been seen (I don't know based on what) The doctor looked at her face and barely examined her and gave a diagnosis, before asking for a single exam. Maybe they think we woke up on a Sunday at 5 am and decided to take a tour of the hospital!! I'm just going to let her take the pain medication and we'll go to another hospital. I know that the common response from the hospital is: “leave your number and full name so we can talk about it” Do you really believe that putting this data publicly here for everyone to see is really something legal these days? Just look at the history of complaints and take action so that others don't go through what many are going through. There are many simply the same complaints about time and quality of service! Solve it!!I always recommended São Camilo as a reference and today I change that!! If you are looking for emergency care, there are other good hospitals in the region!! I no longer recommend it!"

Hey? Like this? Does the agreement release a procedure and all the necessary material and the Hospital simply refuses to release its use? They want to demand a payment of R$2,500.00 to be made to the surgeon so that I can purchase the acid that will be applied by him.This doesn't make any sense and to help, they make it as difficult as possible to contact the Surgery area, and I tried to speak to the center 3 times and the attendant disconnected the call and I had to contact SAC, but the deadline for a return call is 5 working days , that is, I won't have time to resolve this nonsense before the surgery. I never saw that happen! The agreement releases a material and the Hospital says that it will not allow its use and that the patient needs to make private payment."

The boy's first question was:- do you have any idea of ​​the cost of the hospital?????I was thoughtful, I think they should have a little more respect because I have a history at the hospital, last year I was admitted with a lung attack, I left a brand new car at the hospital, I paid for it days after I left ICU, and why did everything this neglect. In this last service? As if I couldn't afford it. You need to be careful, I'm sure it's because they judged my appearance and skin color."

What was disappointing was the waiting time for the doctor. The appointment was great, however, the reception ended my service at around 12:36 pm. I sat in front of the doctor's room door and saw that there was no one in the room, just her. She called me for the appointment at 1:23 pm. It took 47 minutes to wait to be seen. As I mentioned, the consultation was great. I don't know if there was a communication failure between reception and doctor...

I was only attended to because I went to the doctor's office (the doctor who was on duty had already left) and the doctor who welcomed me to the office, who was very helpful with my case as I had been waiting for almost 3 hours for the reevaluation, she found the doctor who had my reevaluation password and the doctor was also extremely attentive and attended to me promptly!

São Camilo Hospital,"Av. Pompéia, 1178 - Pompeia, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Carolina Soares,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Yesterday I went to the Pompéia emergency room as I have been doing for a few years, I was seen by Dr Amanda Bernardes who requested a covid test, I hadn't eaten for 24 hours, no taste, no smell, no strength to walk or talk (everything was tiring). When I was directed to carry out the collection, they placed me in an authorization department room, the employee Wagner said that my plan does not cover the exam and I would have to pay 150.00 reais.At the time I was surprised because 1 and a half years ago I had carried out the same procedure without paying.I was very nervous at the time as I was already extremely tired due to the Covid symptoms and I contacted South America who stated that the hospital should make a request first.In short, the attendant Wagner told me to look for the doctor again, I told him that the doctor wouldn't solve anything. The manager, whose name I don't remember, arrived, without empathy, with a frown and few words.I registered my complaint with Wagner's senior manager and I know I was rude to you, as I was in the emergency room feeling very ill and I was ALONE.To work in the health sector you must have empathy and care for patients, it is even worse for the manager whose role is to have emotional intelligence to deal with clients in this situation, I just wanted to discuss how the hospital deals with the plan, money and protocols?? ? Nobody thinks about the patient?????? Be more human or look for another area to work in, he said he would accompany me to the hospital SAC so that I could register my complaint, I said I didn't need to (an arrogant and arrogant manager with no empathy for the patient), he became the face and walked away. The level of employees, especially in management positions, is absurd.I know I was nervous when talking to them, I was so sick that I cried from the pain in my body and was nervous about the situation, it was my worst experience at the São Camilo Pompéia emergency room with these two boys. I have already operated at São Camilo Santana but after this situation I will no longer be a client of that hospital.I was going to record what happened at the time, but I waited 30 minutes to be seen at the SAC without success. I left because I couldn't take the pain in my body any longer, Covid was collected outside and it came back positive.Stop seeing patients as money or numbers, I was going to pay to take the exam but they were so cold and rude, with no patience with my condition that I paid to take it out!!!!!People in charge of coordination or management need to have patience and wisdom to deal with patients, especially in emergency care."

It's getting ridiculous! Bad reception!"

From diagnosis to referral for surgery.The nursing team until admission was very attentive.The doctor who operated on my son, Dr. Mario Moscaloff, was so careful!!!!! And very professional.He explained everything before the surgery and after, he couldn't have been clearer.He saved my son's life, as he is a goalkeeper and relies heavily on his hands (the fracture was in his hand).It was his first surgery and everyone made him feel very confident. The anesthetist was a friend too, it's a shame I don't remember his name.Anyway, I just have to thank you so much."

It took me 55 minutes to register at reception, ok! But it took me more than two hours to see the doctor, when I went to check in at the reception because there was a client arriving after me and going ahead with the doctor who I was going to see my daughter, even telling you with ill will, disdain and without I apologized and said there was a problem with the system and I wasn't in the waiting line. Worse than spending 3 hours for a consultation is the lack of kindness on the part of the staff. Regrettable!! Worse than SUS!"

São Camilo Hospital,"Av. Pompéia, 1178 - Pompeia, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Hilde Queiroz,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Between screening and reception, the waiting time was adequate. Directed to an ENT who, after waiting almost 1 hour, was asked to go to the clinic, as the ENT was running late in his appointments. This should have already been analyzed when checking in at reception. The medical clinic carried out the usual care carefully and sent him for a COVID test. Where not only me but also the patients who were there were treated very rudely by those responsible for authorizing this exam with the health plans. I refused to carry out such a process with such a rude and stressed person. Clearly overworked and without the structure to handle the stress. I was already feeling bad, I didn't need to go through that anymore. I witnessed a lady calling his attention due to her lack of courtesy. In short, either place more employees in that area or move them to another quieter sector, where they can once again be more polite to others."
São Camilo Hospital,"Av. Pompéia, 1178 - Pompeia, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",mariana hentz,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"Terrible service and logistics. Nothing works, everything is complicated. 40 minutes to go through screening only. Another hour to be seen at reception, after they said I was called, but they didn't call at all. But they insisted without apologizing, as if I hadn't heard my name being called, because I never was on screen. Then another 2 hours to be seen by the doctor, after a lot of insisting that they were calling him the wrong way. The doctor herself said she called it wrong, skipping me. In other words, everything can easily go wrong and there is no way to reverse mistakes. You're there waiting forever, basically. I'm still waiting to return to the office after the x-ray. It's been FOUR HOURS. I don't know when I'll get out of this wait.I will never go back to that place again. This isn't the first time I've been treated poorly, but this was the last straw. I won't go back and I don't recommend it."

I left without being medicated because there was only 1 employee in the adult PS medication room on 10/23/2023 around noon. Elderly people and all patients waiting without knowing when they would be called because the employee informed them that she was alone. How can a hospital of this size leave an employee alone in a medication and observation room? If there is any complication, the patient dies there."
