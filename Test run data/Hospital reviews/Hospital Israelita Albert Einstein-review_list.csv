A child feeling sick, convulsing, shaking all over, even vomiting through his nose. No one came to help him, his parents were desperate. I took the child and broke down the doctors' door so they could see him. Returning to the waiting room, employees and customers live with the vomit without anyone coming to clean it up.Congratulations to the new SUSEINSTEIN"

The news was confirmed by his family and immediately replicated by the most important news portals in the world. The death of one of the best players of all time turned the covers of the main sites black.“The King is dead” was one of the most notable headlines, chosen by the Brazilian newspaper Metro. While Globoesporte described the legacy of Santos' glory as “Infinite”. Immediately the media around the world changed their agenda to bring to the fore the sad news of the death of the man who won three World Cups (1958, 1962 and 1970) in addition to having revolutionized football with his game.The Albert Einstein hospital that treats Pelé said in a statement that his death after a long battle with cancer was caused by ""multiple organ failure."" Named athlete of the century by the International Olympic Committee in 1999, Pelé is the only footballer in history to have won three World Cups, in 1958, 1962 and 1970. Nicknamed “O Rei” (The King), he scored more than 1,000 goals. in one of the most historic careers in the sport, before retiring in 1977.He was in increasingly fragile health, battling kidney problems and colon cancer; He underwent surgery for the latter in September 2021, followed by chemotherapy."

Only those who have been to several hospitals know what makes Einstein different. The negative comments are probably from ""fresh rich"" people who have never tasted the true chaos that a hospital can be. It is certainly impossible to wait for 10 hours of care at this hospital, much less for 50 minutes for the rich man's car to arrive.

Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital,"Av. Albert Einstein, 627/701 - Morumbi, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Lucas Maia,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"I went to the ER with a fever of 39.3. The doctor who treated me analyzed and concluded that they were flu-like symptoms, and that for a young adult it was not necessary or made no difference to know the type or name of the virus.He wrote the recipe, made the certificate and that's it. He didn't ask for an exam, nothing. Besides, to take the intravenous injection, I had to ask for it. “So as not to miss the trip, right Doctor?!?”Anyway, I think that when people look for Einstein they want to know in detail what they have!  With the service I received, I should have gone to Sus, it would have been the same thing and it wouldn't have burdened my plan."

My experience in Chinese communist hospitals was never this bad.  In China the doctor smokes while examining you.Anyways, signed up for a tour of the maternity ward with Y* on June 7, for June 13 at 2pm.  She said she would email me the information.  I never received the email.  My wife and I went to the hospital anyways at 1:45pm and checked in at 1:50pm.  Mind you, we didn't know where we had to be.  No one told us.  we checked in at building A1.I texted Y* again at 1:48pm.  No answer.  A man came down and told us in English that A* would be down in 5 minutes.  I again texted Y* at 2:32pm.  Again, no answer.  Still no A*.  I then texted Steven at 2:39pm.  The man who we first sat down with and met face to face and who connected us with Y*.  Steven made some calls and A* finally arrived at just after 3pm.A* was angry with us as she said she waited at another spot since 1:30pm.  She blamed us.  I tried to tell her were we here but she didn't listen.  For the tour, I asked a few questions about the the birth process and she repeatedly, maybe 7 times, asked me if I know how to get to the correct location in the hospital.  Instead of answering our questions.  Continually reminding us that it was our fault for being late.  It was very rude.The hospital itself was very clean and very nice.  Steven was the only person in this process who wasn't disorganized.  He was the only person who made things happen.  We did have a doctors appointment with a doctor in the A1 building, organized by Steven.  The experience with her was verd good.  But she is independent of the hospital.Its the hospital's lack of organization in MULTIPOLE areas with lead me and my wife to never return and have our baby elsewhere.  Do not go here thinking you need can relax and be worry free.  With the exception of Steven, you need to think for these people.  Its no different than if you been to China.  Although, I never had it this bad in China.  But you paying prices higher than in the USA.My wife's doctors appointment and my healthcare I got in the US.  As well as my wife's appointments in Singapore, was much much cheaper than this hospital.  There are many hospitals in SP and Florianopolis that much much cheaper with better service.  You just won't get the fancy building and good views.I got an automatic email from the hospital asking me how the service was.  i repeated what I wrote here.  I never heard from them.  They don't care.  People, this wasn't 1 person making a mistake that lead to this.  This was multipole people failing and failing multipole times.  This is systemic.EDIT:  The review I made above was made on 20/6/2024.  That day, Albert Einstein Hospital responded below asking for me to give them a call or send them an email.  I will send another email to them.  But I have to point out this is salt in the wound for me.Before I flow to Brazil I emailed the hospital for information and to schedule a time to visit.  They never replied.  I sent that email on 19/4/2024.  I am suppose to email them to talk to someone about this issue.  Using the same email address that they previously didn't reply to?As I mentioned before, this is a hospital wide systemic problem.  NOT one person making a mistake, which we all do at times."

The attendant acted very carelessly, wrote down the phone number on a piece of paper, asking to get in touch via the Call Center. But a girl with long hair at another table was scheduling exams for a lady at the same time and I could hear the conversation. I left there very upset and indignant. When I arrived at the elevator in the building, a lady suggested I go to the shopping mall ahead, to another clinic, which is what I did. The girl in question at Einstein barely looked at my face. I would like to make clear my total frustration. After all, I went to Einstein because they recommended me for a correct diagnosis of my health problem.

It is extremely frustrating and worrying to realize that this delay and difficulty in accessing necessary care may be influenced by unclear patient prioritization criteria. I question whether there is differentiation in treatment between paying patients, artists, or other specific groups, which goes against the principles of equality and justice that we expect from a healthcare institution of its reputation.In my opinion, it does not deserve the excellence that the media promotes, recognized as a leader in Latin America in health services.

He arrived at the emergency room and, as always during his hospitalizations, he spent more than 10 hours on a stretcher, without any possibility of eating, going to the bathroom or relieving himself. There was no priority in your care as usual. It is a great lack of respect from this hospital that was once very good, but unfortunately what really matters to them is holding the patient on stretchers with no expectation of hospitalization.All of this becomes very serious due to his extremely serious state of health.Today again to do an exam, they left my mother without food or drinking any type of liquid for 7 hours, which caused some more serious problems, as she did not take the prescribed medications that ensure her safety in life.The information and internal communications of professionals at this terrible hospital are inconsistent and can lead to the DEATH of our loved one!!!"

Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital,"Av.

He started asking questions and we responded. At a certain point, I asked if it was a preview of the consultation, if Dr. Ivan was present. We heard his voice saying it was time for the appointment, but at no point did we even see his face. I found it strange, but we continued, with his participation sporadically through his voice. At no point did he show his face and he spoke directly to us very few times!Until, unexpectedly, the call was ended. I asked the secretary if she would send a new link, and she said that only at 2 pm, that is, two hours after the consultation should have started. I asked why and she said the doctor couldn't continue at that time. How could it not be, if we were within the scheduled appointment time a long time ago?!A tremendous lack of respect and consideration for the patient and people's time! I was watching the video call from my work and didn't have the option of joining later, which meant that the ""consultation"" ended there, halfway through!When I complained to the secretary, she asked if I wanted to make an appointment at Dr Ivan's private clinic, claiming that ""Nemo is a hospital service, so residents can also participate""!That's the end of the sting, nonsense! Only then did we discover that the pseudo consultation was carried out by an ""intern"", and not by a specialized neurologist, as promised. The least that could have been done was to have informed us and asked if we agreed with this procedure. Total lack of ethics!Very disappointed with the service provided by a hospital as renowned as this one!"

The food is bad, ground meat every day, we weren't able to eat and the coffee and other meals were very poor (bread, butter, fruit and yogurt).Parking is 100.00 per day.Restaurants on site are very expensive, there are no options for the middle class here.There is no coworking space to work or hold meetings, I asked and the nurses tried to help by sending me to a cafe, but there was a lot of noise and the internet didn't work properly.

I have always admired humanized treatment, care for the well-being of patients and nowadays what I see does not match that. I needed to have an endoscopy at the Morumbi unit and the waiting room was full, apparently they booked more patients than the place could actually accommodate. When I was finally called for the procedure, the nurses and doctors were great, but after the procedure, neither of them even came to talk to me to say whether everything went well or not with the exam. While I was recovering from anesthesia, which is a ward full of people with curtains separating the stretchers, the nurse constantly came to reinforce that I was being discharged, basically touching me from recovery to release the stretcher. I left in a wheelchair, as I was still under the influence of sedation and very upset. I don't intend to return, but in any case I recommend Fleury to anyone who is going to have an endoscopy, as their treatment (at least at the Alphaville unit) was much better."

I'm sorry to say that although my entire family has a history recorded in the annals of this institution... it ends with great disappointment and with the certainty of no longer recommending its services..."

I believe I saw a comedian or a circus clown and not a doctor. The consultation didn't take 1 minute, he prescribed medications, one was dipyrone and the other was for rhinitis and runny nose.

I would like to know if he would be happy to know if any of his family members were treated with this disregard, he would like it, besides the fact that I bought a medicine without need and the prices of medicines are absurd.

I had to go to the federal police and then I discovered that Einstein had sent a report including my name on the list of people with covid.The four results were negative but the federal agent didn't even want to see them and apologized for the incident!In short: how can a hospital of this size have such bad laboratory technicians??? How many people have stopped seeing their parents?elderly people, their children or failed to resolve professional problems due to this errorhospital and did not have the opportunity to retake the test or because they were unable tofinancial resources to pay for another test as it is very expensive, and they were harmed by this hospital's errors! A shame for Albert HospitalEibstein! If you make a mistake in a simple covid test, imagine other more complicated tests, the mistakes you shouldn't make!!!!!A shame! And a warning for those of us who believe that Einstein is a hospital of excellence! I hope I never need the services of this hospital again!"

The nurses even got my hair done - I always had nice hair during my “stay.” ❤️Happy things about hard times. This hospital and its staff got my heart; it’s my hospital of choice around the world.AE is one of the top 50 best hospitals in the world, but I’ve already been to 2 of the top 5 - the service quality at the Albert Einstein is incomparable and way far better."

The hospital already has a reputation that needs no comment. This report is about my impression regarding my service. I was very impressed! From the reception, then the temperature measurement, the people who give information on the way, the emergency room reception, the person who took me to an attached waiting room because the main waiting room was full, the nurses and the doctor. Everyone served me in an exceptional way. The body posture, the diction, the way of expressing oneself, the words used, receptivity when addressing me. Congratulations to the entire team! Congratulations to HR for training customer service at such a high level.Another big difference is the convenience services. Sweet shops, coffee shops, restaurants, clothing stores, cosmetics and various necessary products. There is a Starbucks store, Kopenhagen, Bacio di Latte! There is a photo exhibition with the history of the hospital, which is very interesting! I posted photos of everything!"

How can a patient be expected to rest in such an inappropriate place? There are silence signs everywhere in the hospital, but it is the hospital itself that breaks the rule. Sounds of whistles, renovation and construction machines, people talking loudly, rooms without proper sound insulation.

And now I'm at home with the same pain and I can't admit myself to hospital to see if they can fix this poorly done and poor quality work.

I was informed that yes, according to the email received later by Einstein, whose control number was 000011320960. In that email I even had the necessary preparations.To my surprise, upon arriving at the Av Brasil unit, on 06/25, I was informed by the attendant that these tests would not be covered by my plan because the request was from a doctor and not from a doctor. Obviously I questioned this information because I called in advance to obtain all the necessary information. At that moment, the attendant went to consult the person responsible for the morning shift to check if an exception could be made and she informed her that there was nothing she could do, in other words, I wasted my morning due to a serious error by Einstein that was not passed. the information correctly and did not give a better solution than a mere apology. Additionally, I had to go to all the trouble of rescheduling my return visits to health professionals, due to delays in the exam schedule initially planned."

At least until I'm about 70 years old.I already went to the USP university hospital, because I had broken my hand and in less than 2 hours I was leaving with it in a cast.

As I have more compliments than complaints, I come here to suggest:The medication room at the Pediatric P.S. could have a separation or better isolation of the children who use it.The fact that they share the same environment with children with the most varied clinical conditions exposes them to possible contamination. I'm not a doctor and it's a fact that I can't determine the cause, but based on my experiences as a mother and in parallel with my children as a patient too, I happened to take them with a clinical condition and ""soon"" after the treatment the appearance of new symptoms, usually viral. Therefore, I humbly believe that if there were better isolation of the children who are being medicated, the risk of contamination would be minimized, a fact that I am fully aware of its difficulty in implementing, but totally relevant in a hospital with a unique reference in treatment."
