On 11/30/24, unfortunately I was diagnosed with Ectopic Pregnancy, and I needed to be hospitalized and undergo surgery as I could bleed to death.At the screening I was seen by Dr Daniel (night shift), who took great care of me at such a difficult time in my life, thank you Dr. I would also like to thank the Nursing Technician Josi who welcomed me, talked to me and showed me affection before my surgery , thank you very much.In the morning I was attended to by a nurse who I also forgot her name, and who came to my bed to talk to me to calm me down, she talked to me and gave me a lot of support until she took me to the operating room and said that she would be praying for me, thank you very much May God bless your life so much.The doctors who performed my transvaginal surgery (unfortunately I don't remember the name) were incredible, excellent, patient and very welcoming.And a special thank you to Anesthetist Jorge Moriata (if I'm not mistaken that's his last name), who was an excellent doctor, who helped me a lot, calmed me down, gave me a lot of emotional support, I can't even describe what he did You did it for me, thank you very much Doctor, I will never forget that day, may God bless you and your whole family.The surgeons and the entire nursing team, unfortunately I don't remember everyone's name, but you were excellent, human, empathetic. Thank you all, Thank you very much for everything, thank you very much and I ask God to continue using you to do good, like they did to me.May God bless you all. Amen."

Summary of the opera, more than 12 hours without eating or drinking, at the mercy of doctors providing time and resources to perform the surgery.I wanted to see if it was a relative of the doctors, if they wouldn't find a place quickly. The excuse is always the same ""people have priority, it comes urgently"", but in addition to not taking into account empathy and common sense with a patient without eating or drinking for more than 12 hours, they did not take into account the fact that the patient is 57 years old !!!Hospital is only good for those who have money.

Completely unprepared team, true people who are there just for the salary, because everyone lacks empathy, resilience and even professionalism. They are negligent about patient care and safety.Yesterday, when I visited my mother, I noticed that she didn't have her feeding, hydration and IV tube connected, I questioned the nursing staff and they told me that I would have to speak to the doctor. I asked them to call the doctor so I could talk and the game of pushing and shoving began, as he wasn't the technician responsible for caring for my mother, who didn't know anything, even the nurse was completely harsh and rude when I approached the first person on duty. . Visiting hours were over and no one had resolved my mother's issue. It was only around 4 pm that the doctor appeared and that's when the nursing team began to mobilize. my mother, because it was found that she should start the serum at 10 am and the feeding afterwards and it was 4 pm and they had done nothing, after all the trouble that started her care.  For a patient who has to stay hydrated due to nephrological issues, this only demonstrates the negligence and unwillingness to work on the part of the entire team."
Clinical Hospital FMUSP,"R. Dr. Ovídio Pires de Campos, 225 - Cerqueira César, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",TT G,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"The Hospital das Clínicas FMUSP, by its nature, created to be a teaching center for USP medical students, suffers from its reputation for high scientific capacity with the high demand that has developed in the public health sector from the government. You will always be attended by undergraduate students mentored by experienced and recognized doctors, which is part of your excellence. What can be seen is the lack of investment in both infrastructure and instrumentation in some sectors. However, we can see that the reception area of ​​the outpatient clinic has been renovated, and regardless of the queue, service is streamlined and the environment is renewed. The HC enjoys a reputation and is consequently charged. The scheduling system is completely automated, you don't leave there without a paper in hand about any upcoming procedure, be it an exam or a return appointment, and you are always treated cordially. I can't talk about the hospitalization sector and the health insurance sector because I don't know it. Many people expect to be cared for their entire lives in the same hospital, however, the objective of any treatment is to complete it, and if the doctor finds the treatment completed, you will be discharged and should see your doctor at the UBS for follow-up, if necessary.The HC, although a reference in public health, limited service years ago to continue providing services through the SUS, respecting protocols, even so, it feels overwhelmed by the time it takes to receive care. That's why access is so difficult, unfortunately. If you are already a patient, be sure to find out about the procedures. For new patients, appointments are made through the CROSS system, a public health regulation that you can find out about at your UBS."

I called the center at number (11) 4673-4333 on 07/26/2024 at 9:11 am and scheduled an appointment with Dr Caio Petrus on 08/27/2024 at 7 am, through the Bradesco agreement. Well, 1 month waiting for the appointment and needing medication to sleep, I still decided to wait because the IPQ has good references. Today it was 8 degrees, freezing COLD and even so I got up at 5:30 am to go to the appointment (I barely slept for fear of wasting time). Because it was VERY cold and I live a medium distance away, my husband wanted to take me and missed work (missed his daily allowance) because he knew this appointment was VERY important for me. Arriving at the reception, I simply received a notice that there are no appointments at 7am there and that even less was there an appointment scheduled for me. My floor fell out! Like this? I called the center again and the answer was the SAME! No appointment scheduled! They asked the NAME of the attendant who made the appointment, how would I know?? They DO NOT provide a call protocol and you have NO GUARANTEE that your appointment is actually scheduled. They offered me an appointment at 10 am or 12 pm (it was 7 am!!!!) I would have to wait for 3 hours and they offered me proof of hours but regardless of that I needed to go to work, I didn't tell work that I was going to be absent, because That's right, I booked it OUTSIDE my working hours! I will also offer a consultation tomorrow 28/08, but it would be ANOTHER commute and ABSENCE at work, which is not viable as these are crucial days for me. I had a horrible crying fit and left desolate with so much IRRESPONSIBILITY precisely from an environment where WELCOME and Humanity should be found, we are talking about mental health, right? No one knows what happened to my appointment and I wouldn't have known the Dr's name for nothing, if I hadn't called and been told it had been scheduled. I will open an Ombudsman and register a complaint here. IPQ NEVER AGAIN!"

However, with SUS care there is a difference in treatment and they don't hide it. I stayed the night in an observation space, where there was no bell and stuck on a stretcher with a broken foot. I couldn't have a companion, but they said there is a law that women have the right to a companion.  But the people who had an accepted agreement were with a companion.  I was left in a space with the door closed alone, stuck on the stretcher. If I needed help, there was no way to call and I needed it because I wanted to use the bathroom. The only bathroom far down the hall, there was no toilet paper, a clogged toilet. It was a night of horror! To have foot surgery, but the next day they said they wouldn't do it in my case. Not that I wanted to do it, I wanted the treatment that was more effective and faster. I was in doubt, because each resident said something and they said that the surgery was almost certain, they were just going to see what the procedure would be and I felt like I was waiting for time to glue my heel and not occupy the surgical center and a place in the ward."

Not even a doctorate, this bastard deserves it!I was hospitalized under the agreement for a period of 14 days, during which I was very well looked after by the rheumatologists (especially Dr. Steeven), the psychiatrist, neurologist, on-call doctors, team of nurses and technicians, nutrition team, cleaning, social worker, everyone was wonderful.My problem has a name: Aleia Faustina Campos. In addition to having lied about my exams and omitting information, he also had the courage to want to blame his negligence on other people, releasing me without a controlled medication, which I used during the period I was hospitalized twice a day. This medicine causes a withdrawal crisis when abruptly stopped. In addition to releasing me without a new reevaluation from a psychiatrist/neuro, so that I would have medication until the moment I could get an appointment with a specialist, she barred the emergency room team from helping me today and said for me to seek out a specialist from my insurance plan on my own or see a neurologist there, who has the same deadline as the specialist under my insurance plan of +1 month.In other words, I'm left with a withdrawal crisis, without being able to sleep or eat since I was discharged (the eating problem was already recurring during my hospitalization and only got worse).I can't work properly, I can't have peace, I can't do absolutely ANYTHING, because of a mistake that wasn't mine. I wasn't in the SUS ward, not that it's any less important, but I was PAYING and PAYING DEARLY to be in a renowned hospital, and I'm having all this trouble. I didn't have peace because of Aleia while I was hospitalized and now I'm living this nightmare and neglect again by the same ""boss"" of the health insurance. It worries me that such an irresponsible 'doctor' is treated like a boss. How many lives were neglected by her? I opened an ombudsman, which so far has been of no use.I'm going to open another one, contact the ANS and take legal action and with the regional medical council, because I'm TIRED of this nonsense."

This happened at the Lapa hospital, where I arrived with a super strong headache and fever and they gave me medication for nausea and dismissed me, after staying overnight I found a UPA, who took me in and even then they asked me to go to the HC , as they were unable to carry out the necessary tests on site, due to the chronic illness in question.Today I went to the hospital due to an appointment I requested and discovered that serious inflammation was already starting, which they never discovered at the UPA, almost 2 weeks looking for help, due to the HCFMUSP PS not being able to attend, but thank God I started the treatment because from the outpatient clinic, I was referred to the PS and everything went fine.The reference hospital should review some procedures, I don't understand why this has been the case since 2018 if I'm not mistaken, but now they don't enter the ER even though they are very ill, this is leading some patients to wait in very painful situations. I developed fever and inflammation because they didn't know what to do with me in another hospital, I know it's not right but there are professionals who dismiss us and I write here for many of the patients at HCFMUSP.I know that care cannot be denied in other hospitals, but they don't know what to do with us, and sometimes the headache starts and when we arrive at the HC we see that nothing has been done, and we are getting worse.We need PS, no one is looking for PS on a whim, but because it is painful for us to wait for the correct treatment."

Dr. Ovídio Pires de Campos, 225 - Cerqueira César, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Michel Benchimol,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"By far the worst hospital I've ever been to, lucky for me, I'm not dependent on the SUS, but I'm worried about the many people who need care and can't get it. It took 5 hours to wait, only to find out that there were still more than 50 people in front of me and only one doctor attending to everyone.A patient was feeling ill for hours and was in the hospital to remove a pH monitoring probe. The nurse's response was: ""if you're standing up, you can wait a little longer!"" And he left, completely ignoring the patient. The same patient left the room crying, because no one knew how to provide correct information.In the hospital, it is normal to see people without masks, including the doctors and nurses themselves (not all of them). It was 5 hours in the hospital before I gave up, after almost 2 years of fighting for this appointment, after a SUS employee committed fraud while carrying out her role and even lied saying that she had spoken to me, when I hadn't even received a call that day. who spoke to me (evidence is being collected to be presented in CRIMINAL proceedings). After waiting, I asked for my referral back, and I claimed that I would never be seen by a doctor who even wears a mask, the nurse's response was: ""Never mind, take care of yourself"", but I don't think the nurse knows that since 2022 there has been a law that says it is mandatory for doctors, nurses and hospital administrators to wear masks. And when asked about the waiting time, the answer was: ""if you don't want to wait, go to Einstein"", and the appointment was scheduled for 12:10, the service forecast according to my calculations, considering each appointment lasting 5 minutes (which we know doesn't exist), it would take more than 4 hours to be seen, and I arrived at the hospital at 11 am as requested in the referral. Basically, the nurse's speech made it clear: if you don't have money, you don't deserve dignity and respect, you don't deserve to be seen at the scheduled time. To be clear, the conversation with the nurse was recorded and will be used as evidence of this hospital's negligence towards its patients.To conclude, I went to a general practitioner to be referred to a gastro specialist, the clinician even tried to refer me straight to surgery, which unfortunately could not be done. I went to the first gastro in the right time network in the city of Ademar, and then I saw a surgeon also from the right time network, who made the surgical referral (only from the SUS, there were 3 surgical referrals from 3 different doctors), after a waiting time , I got the appointment at this hospital, and when I arrived, they said it was just a screening to see if we would have the surgery there, if it was a case of surgery or if I would be transferred to another place, even though I had been referred for surgery by a SURGEON, without considering you two other doctors from SUS, and 6 more doctors from the health insurance, would I pass a screening? None of these doctors I went to were qualified? Was only the HC doctor qualified? Not even the SUS surgeon was qualified? If I was going to do all this, why did they book it at HC? Why haven't they already made an appointment at a minimally qualified hospital? Doctors had access to all exams!!! And they ignored it. And, let's face it, 10/11 hours to be seen at SCREENING? What is that? At least a crime. May the people who depend on this rubbish service be lucky and stay well (and without infection or covid caught by one of the hospital staff)."

You have to ""bother"" someone to help you. After much reluctance, the attendant takes you to the consultation floor and another surprise! When your password appears on the indicated floor, it is actually to go to the infirmary to be screened for an appointment that has already been scheduled. And let's go downstairs to do the screening. Once the triage is done, they send them back to the care floor, but the bizarreness doesn't end there, after waiting 1 hour and seeing other ""impatient"" patients leaving after waiting for a doctor for more than 3 hours, surprisingly, they didn't show up. , there was no satisfaction, no one at the hospital could talk to the ""blessed"" to find out what to do with the patients, I discovered that the ""blessed"" is the same doctor I had booked an appointment with!

Better than medical insurance, the doctors are specialists, there isn't the push and shove of a doctor seen in health plans (and one of the most expensive ones I've had access to in the past), the doctors are accurate in the specific treatment you need. It is one of the only places worth paying taxes in BR, every SUS and health ministry should be disciplined, guided and headed by the same administration as the HC in São Paulo. Since we are talking about leading this country (which has been adrift for more than 70 years), not only the HC of Sao Paulo, but Rota (from PMSP) is also worth every cent of tax paid, which is why São Paulo is the largest State in the country, these two institutions need to have greater investment and autonomy, they are the ones that keep SP afloat, the rest is political nonsense. I could include other institutions, but I mentioned here the ones I know best. São Paulo strong always!"

I cannot mention the names of all the doctors, attending nurses and other professionals, but my family and I owe our eternal gratitude to ALL HC employees. My daughter Caroline O. Alexandre and I owe our lives to each one of you who did everything for us, not only with regard to cancer, but also other diseases that were also investigated and treated, whether or not they were sequelae of Lymphoma. Before, during and after our treatment at the Cancer Hospital, it was the HC that gave us all the medical support beyond (extra cancer) because we even had surgery on the digestive system at the HC after chemotherapy at Icesp and radiotherapy at Inrad. I know it is an injustice not to mention the names of all those who treated me, for almost 3 years in the care, hospitalization, surgery, general practice, otorhinolaryngology, gastroenterology, head and neck treatment sectors, but I have kept all the names of those who saved my life and my daughter's life, also at HC, before and after cancer treatment. Doctors, nurses, attendants and other HC employees also wear the shirt of the place where they work and are truly dedicated to saving lives.My 3 sisters and I entered the HC for the first time in 1967, all affected by measles and chickenpox, (I was 7 years old and today I'm 62 years old) and thank God and the professionals at the HC we are all alive thanks to the treatments we provided. received.At HC, INRAD, ICESP, INCOR and other sectors we really learned the meaning of the name PATIENT, and patient means being patient, calm, having hope, having faith, being of good cheer, understanding the other side, being generous. have peace, excluding (banishing) from ourselves: the fear, the despair, the lack of faith from when we first got there. Because we know that there are people there who are highly qualified and dedicated to the professionals and human beings they are. PATIENT does not mean being SICK, but being patient, peaceful, hopeful, being someone who has hope and knowing that they are in the best place to treat their health.During the period of chemotherapy, hospitalization and consultations, I witness the effort that each ICESP employee makes to save the lives of all their patients.YOU ALL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN PUBLIC HEALTH IN BRAZIL.YOU ARE INSTRUMENTS WHICH GOD USES TO WORK MIRACLES, HEAL, GIVE GOOD CHEERFUL, HEALTH AND WILL TO LIVE TO EVERY PERSON WHO NEEDS CARE FOR THEIR HEALTH.MY ETERNAL GRATITUDE TO EVERYONE AT HOSPITAL DAS CLINICAS DE SÃO PAULO, INRAD, ICESP, INCOR....Thank you very much!Wilson S. Alexandre."

An 80-year-old woman with advanced Alzheimer's was taken to the HU for evaluation due to a fall and was treated as if she were almost destitute. They asked for my phone number to notify her of anything since I was unable to stay by her side as required by the law for the elderly, and the nothing happened, I stayed there, no doctor was able to give me any information and they sent her back to the HU without telling me that on the 26th, right after admitting her they sent me home, on the 28th they did the same thing but on that day day was there and thanks to God, an employee warned me and I was able to demand that a doctor come down to talk to me otherwise she would stay right there, she came with great unwillingness and to top it off yesterday, September 2nd, I went back to this hospital with my mother for another evaluation and they did the Same thing, they sent my mother back to the H U, leaving me in the container without any information, finding out later that she was already in the H U. The neglect is so great that not even with the police did the neuro team come down to talk to me. It was up to an employee Letícia and a doctor from the surgical clinic to give an explanation in which it was the fault of not having been informed that it was the ambulance team I was transporting and a little more mine. I'm sorry that in a reference hospital like people are turning into machines forgetting empathy with the suffering of others."

The vast majority of employees had disposable masks and that is not enough for this hospital. All employees, including non-clinical attendants and security guards, should wear n95. It is unacceptable that the HC, led by health professionals, does not require the use and distributes n95 masks. I also advise you to create ""stands"" to sell n95 to patients with pamphlets explaining the correct use (see the Twitter profile @estoque_pff which informs about and promotes affordable PFF2 masks)."
