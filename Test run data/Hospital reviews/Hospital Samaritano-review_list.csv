Conselheiro Brotero, 1486 - Higienópolis, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Paulo Motti,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",2 days ago,"After another 30 years of going to Samaritano, I only notice it getting worse. I believe that institutions have become worse and people even worse. Before you could see a love for the profession of serving others, now it is rare. The delay in medicating a patient in pain is inexplicable. I need to summarize. If you want quick service, it’s no longer at Samaritano."

Hospital Samaritano,"R. Conselheiro Brotero, 1486 - Higienópolis, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Roberta Crisppi,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",3 days ago,"I went with my husband. The hospital had no one. To the flies. After the exams were ready (which took 2 hours) they took around an hour and 40 minutes. to call to reevaluate. I went to question what was happening 4 times. Firstly, I couldn't find a single soul to complain. When I thought they would say they would call soon. Anyway, nurses said it was the fault of the doctors on duty. It is not my obligation to know who it belongs to. I only record the few cases in the hospital!!!!"
Hospital Samaritano,"R. Conselheiro Brotero, 1486 - Higienópolis, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Patricia Feres Trielli,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",3 days ago,"I hadn't used the P.S at Hospital Samaritano for many years and I was horrified by the drop in the quality of care provided by the doctor and nurses. I entered as a priority because I was in the hospital's own post-operative period. However, I had to wait and beg several times to be served. When attended to, the doctor on duty, Dr Andressa, went. At the very least, careless. I informed her that I was allergic to dipyrone and she still prescribed the medication. I asked her to contact my doctor and she ignored it. I received an email requesting tests, which I didn't take!!! In the measurement room, the nurse took my vein, but didn't close the valve and the blood flowed out. They dropped material on the floor. It is clear that the level of employees has dropped considerably. Although I have no complaints about my surgery, the experience at the P.S. was pitiful!!! What a shame."

Doctors don't give information, there is terrible communication between the team, nobody knows what they are doing.My mother needed urgent ICU care but we spent two days in the emergency room at the PS. They promised a room and nothing. My mother was getting worse every hour and no one paid attention, she was fasting, the diaper was not being changed, a total discomfort, until I called the police and registered a police report and asked them to go to the place. While I was fighting for my mother's life, she was intubated. When the police arrived, an ICU room “appeared” within 30 minutes. And it didn't stop there, after being extubated we waited for the speech therapist's visit for 12 hours. This is INHUMANE!!! My mother cried with thirst and hunger.

And as if that weren't enough, after all that, the finance company claims that they carried out an exam on my son, but the doctor didn't warn me that it was a private exam and carried it out anyway, without my authorization and therefore, I have a ""due"" charge and before any contact with me, they sent the notification to Serasa.Moms from all over the world, I recommend that you take your children to another hospital, as it is not worth the stress just for the way it looks."

Hospital Samaritano,"R. Conselheiro Brotero, 1486 - Higienópolis, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Denise Kalajian,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"This Hospital was once good! If you have elderly relatives, don't take them there. My mother was admitted to this hospital with pain from a herniated disc at the age of 83, and the doctor gave us a series of medicines, including morphine, being elderly, one must be careful with medication and released us, 1 day after we returned to the hospital with the same pain but we argued with the doctor who barely looked at my mother and already medicated her again and the pain didn't go away, more morphine, we demanded her hospitalization, since she hadn't eaten for 2 days, and he admitted her to We reluctantly stayed until 4am even with the agreement released for a room, total negligence and what happened? My mother had a drop in consciousness, her blood pressure dropped to 2, and we went to ICU, and she didn't wake up for 3 days, when she woke up, she was suffering from deliryum that no doctor could explain or give us the reason for. We were discharged and went home with delirium and everything, we spent 15 days changing night for day, and we went back to the hospital, and that's when our problems got worse, uti, very low blood pressure, bronchoaspiration, discharge to their semi uti, which, by the way, leaves a lot to be desired, where my mother became infected with a KPC bacteria, you see, super bacteria, and we returned to uti, bedsores on the sacral part opened and we passed 88 days in that ICU, fighting for life. They intubated, untubated, performed a tracheo, and she lost the reserve she no longer had. The worst was yet to come, when they simply decreed that there would be no other way, the ICU doctors came to pressure us every other day, saying that she was not responding to treatment, I think they wanted us to take some drastic action, damn it was ours mother there. Without empathy, with soft voices, wolves in sheep's clothing, do you think they are worried about you, the patient and the family? Of course not, they want to vacate the place. And after all, they still sedated her, after other complications unexpected by them, and then things got worse for good, because it seemed like they had put an X on the door, and they were no longer paying attention to us, the nurses barely spoke to us.  Is this palliative? They are mistaken, they put the patient in comfort and leave the patient last, after all he is sedated. Oh and there's no point in complaining, the doctor thinks he has the right to shout at family members, saying that we should let our mother rest, is that his mother? Or you complain to the head of nursing and she says, look, I'm sorry you're going through this. That's a lie, they don't feel anything, they're used to family members who don't question, don't notice anything, do what they want. And in the end, on the day she left, they called, it was on a Sunday, saying that the doctor wanted to speak to the family, I went into the ICU and no one said anything to me, and when I open the door and say, hi mom, I'm here, I come across my deceased mother in bed, covered with a sheet and the devices turned off. I almost fainted, they weren't careful, they didn't have love for others, respect, empathy, consideration, neither doctors nor nursing, then after I started crying and screaming, a physio appeared saying look, she was weak. Do you really think that no one knew that a death had occurred? To open the door normally? Then, after the shit is done, they call a psychologist to calm us down, and the head nurse comes, the doctor says rest, spare me. In reality, they determined the day, time, through all the conversations between the lines, my sisters and I knew that the feeling we have is that we have to vacate the bed. The sac doesn't work, no one is punished, they do what they want. We are very sorry, we lost our mother, she entered the hospital with sciatic nerve pain and practically never left. I transcribe here the Indignation of our 3 daughters, me, Luciana and Alessandra Kalajian.We are waiting for a retraction from the hospital, if the managers of this unit have the least amount of responsibility and care for their patients, you can call us and we will gladly report personally everything that happened, even though our mother will not be returning."

Hospital Samaritano,"R. Conselheiro Brotero, 1486 - Higienópolis, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Thiago Cunha,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"Hello, I am currently admitted to Hospital Samaritano Higienópolis and had surgery today (09/17/24) in the navel area (possibly an abscess, from the little information we got) and I would like to express my deep dissatisfaction with the lack of medical care provided by the surgeon Reinaldo Neto. Both in the pre-operative outpatient care and during and after the surgery, I had almost zero clarity about what would/was/was done. The doctor was not actively willing to provide details of the path we would take or what it would be like during the surgery, what the pre-surgery and, most importantly, the post-surgery would be like. After the surgery was over, the doctor did not appear in the recovery room (I was awake the entire time) to monitor my status and did not even appear in the room to share information about how it had been with my partner (my mother). Both she and I were a little anxious about this lack of information and worried about what precautions we should take. After asking for nursing, the aforementioned doctor called the room and in addition to having to ask about fairly basic information such as what was done, what it actually was, etc., I asked him to kindly come to the room so we could talk. The doctor denied it and said he was no longer at the hospital. I asked if he was coming to discharge me tomorrow (18/09/24) and he said he wouldn't be coming. The discharge would be provided by one of his assistants. The information regarding expected discharge, post-operative care, food, medication, leave time and other matters were not clear in the call.One fact I would like to share is that I entered the surgery center after having my surgery scheduled by the doctor without having done pre-operative exams, such as the basic blood test and electrocardiogram.Therefore, this was my surgical experience at the Samaritano Higienópolis hospital: absence of medical support during the entire procedure, from start to finish. This caused a lot of anxiety for me as a patient and for my mother especially. We were very sad and dissatisfied with all of this and it created a feeling that I had merely been a purely commercial activity in this surgical process. Extremely difficult to give a positive recommendation assessment after this episode."

The case of the treatment of my mother, an 84-year-old woman, for a fall is, to say the least, bizarre!  It all started with a crude tomography report, full of errors, where no visible vertebrae fracture was detected.  If the wrong report wasn't enough, the doctor who released us from the ER must not have even looked at the images and was just based on the wrong report.  Or, if he looked, he also didn't know how to interpret the images, as he informed us that neither crack nor fracture had occurred.  But the worst was later: we returned to the ER at Hospital Samaritano a week later, with my mother reporting an absurd increase in pain. The pain, which was previously more in the costal region, spread intensely to both legs.  In other words, any layman would have raised the alarm: an 84-year-old woman who had all the CT scans, was treated and returned to the ER a week later, reporting an absurd increase in pain, cannot be seen as something normal.  The minimum expected course of action would be for the doctor to re-examine the CT scans and, if necessary, request an urgent MRI.  Well, we were seen by an orthopedic doctor, who didn't even examine my mother and just gave the verdict: it was a pinched sciatic nerve!  He prescribed an injection of Diprospan and released us!  It takes a lot of incompetence to act like that.  I, a layman, have already learned from this single experience.  Now, imagine an experienced doctor who has seen hundreds of cases like this, not taking any precautions, not re-examining the images and not even requesting an MRI!!!  How can someone who acts with such negligence call themselves a doctor!  Well, my mother returned home, we increased the dosages of neuropathic medications and none of the pain reduced.  Finally, we went to the ER at Hospital Samaritano for a third time and only then were we lucky enough to be seen by a competent doctor, who examined my mother and ordered an MRI, which would clearly indicate the fracture.  The same fracture that was already apparent and easy to see on the initial CT scans.  This delay in detecting the problem hurt my mother a lot and was caused by 3 incompetent doctors working in the same place, the PS at Hospital Samaritano, which I wouldn't recommend even to my worst enemy!"

And from what I saw, they give protocol answers here on Google Review. Today I had one of the worst experiences of my life in terms of hospital care. I had several exams scheduled and I was advised to arrive 30 minutes early to open the form. I arrived 45 minutes early and it took more than 30 minutes for me to be called by reception. I raised my concerns with the person assisting me, as I was in an uncomfortable fasting state, unable to drink water and unable to urinate. The person treated me with disregard and said that I was the one who didn't want to be helped, so he wouldn't guide me. At the time when I was supposed to take the first exam, I was still in front of the attendant and I complained that I would be late for the exam, she then suggested that I go and take the exam and then give the token to release the laboratory tests, since the rest had been released. I accepted the suggestion, did the first exam and saw that the token was already available, so I asked the attendant in front of the women's unit to pass the token to reception. She was extremely rude and said exams were still being released. I wanted to show her that no, that the exams were already released on the app. She refused to receive the token and said she was busy assisting someone else. I returned to the women's unit and performed the next exam crying, and the subsequent exam in the same way. I called SAC and asked someone to come there to help me, but no one showed up. I continued taking the exams until someone from reception arrived, 47 minutes after the token had already been released, saying they would help me. I handed her the token and went on to collect the laboratory tests, which did not have the forms ready because they had not received the token until that moment. I already had an exploding bladder and was at the limit of the fasting window for collecting blood tests. After a lot of pressure, I managed to perform these tests with 1 minute left to break the 14 hour fast and I was unable to perform the urine test as I still had an ultrasound that needed to be done first. I stayed in this marathon for 5 hours, I was treated in the worst possible way. When I finished, I went to SAC to file a complaint and as I was leaving the hospital, I had a flash of memory that my urine test hadn't been labeled. I ran back to SAC super nervous and they didn't want to help me because they said there were other people in front. I was distressed and was being poorly attended to since 7 am, I wasn't arriving at that moment and requesting immediate assistance. When I realized that not even the SAC would help me, I rushed back to the laboratory, where I was confirmed that my urine sample had been thrown in the trash because it had no label. I was in shock, I spent 3 uncomfortable hours holding my urine, I received poor treatment from several professionals and at the end of it all, they threw my test in the trash. The team at all times tried to blame the agreement's bureaucracy (which was not true as the agreement had released the exams) and on me, not believing my word. The reality is that Samaritano has an unprepared and inhumane team. I do not recommend the hospital."

My father actually had to go to the ER a few years ago with dengue and was sent home with antibiotics. His condition worsened until he was hospitalized and they detected the exact cause of his symptoms.As for my experience, I was served quickly, cordially and comfortably. I was also entitled to a coffee, juice and a snack. It would be worth 5 stars. However, Samaritano urgently needs to reinforce the PS, increasing the number of professionals and improving its processes."

I was discharged, I went home. I started to feel sick around 10 am, with a lot of discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Guided by the pp hospital, we returned, this time to the PS. After waiting for 1/2 hour, we were taken to a ward called REST AND OBSERVATION. After waiting 1h1/2, without being served, we decided to go home, such was the disrespect and neglect. We tried to explain with the doctor on duty who ignored us, remained in her closed room, while 6 elderly people (3 in wheelchairs) were waiting to be seen. I am 70 years old; my companion, 75; there were others even older than us. This young doctor says her name is Carla. Just check who was on duty that day, between 12:30 pm and 2 pm. We paid a lot for the Health Plan, we were in a very well-regarded hospital, in an excellent neighborhood. I conclude that none of this is of any use, because what really counts is the dignity and commitment of the professional, of the human being, to their profession. And Dr. Carla (if that's really her name) dishonors the profession she chose, as well as several other professionals who were in that wing of Hospital Samaritano Higienópolis today and remained indifferent to our pain, disrespected our rights, abandoning us. us. Shameful!Today, 03/04/24, Monday, I contacted the number the hospital suggested, spoke to Simone, explained again what had happened. Everything is clarified. Thank you for your attention and respect.

Now it is 1am this Monday and she finds herself in the hospital with the child with a fever and demands the results of the child's exams. It's absurd if the child, in God's grace, won't have anything serious, but only exams can confirm it, but if God forbid it were something serious, the child could be at risk of death; as the doctor did not give any medication in the early hours of Sunday as there was no blood test result.mwhats 9703_23386"

But with the pandemic... and diagnosed with cancer I sought care and, of course I was very well looked after by the dear and competent professional oncologist Dr. Beatriz Abraao Kinute.  who, unfortunately, is no longer in the hospital...I still give credibility to the hospital, but after the pandemic, the hospital administration has a staff of doctors who are very young and unprepared... in all areas... be it medical, nursing and administrative, which in a way has caused a drop in little quality of care... since the hospital is located in a noble region of the capital.Last November I fell and broke my arm.... I went to the hospital, which, too. known for excellence in the field of orthopedics... again I got a very young and inexperienced orthopedist who chose to forcefully put my arm back in place... and then put it in a cast... after the second X-ray, she gave me the sad news that it hadn't turned out well and there I went again after her torture and 2 other nurses... put a cast on and dismissed me... when I returned 15 days after I ended up seeing another orthopedist in the same hospital, he stayed Perplexed, he looked at the x-ray on the computer, looked at me.. and said: I don't understand why they didn't operate on you that day.... well, I'm still here suffering today... I hope they get better and return to the quality they were before."

Glory to God!  So what?  What's the problem?We cried, prayed and concluded that nothing would change in our lives, and we were convinced that this child would receive everything that every child in the world should receive; Love, Affection and United Family.I, as the father and grandfather of this wonderful child still in the womb, would be calmer and more at peace if I knew that the aforementioned doctor had made at least one phone call apologizing for the medical error committed. Errors are common to all professionals, but the accuracy of the examination carried out would have provided greater care needed for both in advance.I leave here my consternation as a human being, citizen and Christian.Hugs'It's the text I wrote in 2019 and when I looked through things, I found it and I leave my feelings here.Merry Christmas everyone!(*my granddaughter is naughty and is love personified!)"

The nurses also started to get nervous and the perception was that they didn't know what to do. They ended up calling the two gynecology doctors who came to talk to me and while I was in tears at the height of the anxiety attack, they asked me if I wanted to talk (who does that???). I explained (AGAIN) in the midst of sobbing tears that I was in the middle of a crisis and I really needed to be medicated because I was getting too out of control. The two doctors started saying that they couldn't prescribe “the medicine I wanted” (one of them said these words) - I didn't want a specific medicine, I wanted some doctor to do something to get me out of the crisis. I'm not a doctor, they were the doctors, they had to know what to do!!!!!NOBODY KNEW WHAT TO DO, the nurses took me to the back beds because I was already very out of control and crying very loudly, so they tried to hide me. They called my husband and my husband had to interrupt the appointment he was having with another doctor (general practitioner). My husband asked the general practitioner to come and see me, and the doctor immediately prescribed me a tranquilizer. I took it and in FIVE MINUTES I was calm.My husband needed to do something because the entire team present left me in the middle of a severe anxiety attack for more than 30 minutes. It was terrible, I was even afraid of having to go back to that hospital.Shame on the doctors who treated me that day. They left me in a state of absurd and worse suffering, instead of quickly referring me to another doctor (because it's understandable that sometimes we don't know how to deal with everything and that's ok), they kept justifying why they couldn't give me medicine and blah blah while I was freaking out. in the middle of the hospital in a crisis.No one needs to know everything, but referring me to another professional and having a similar approach to cases like this IS THE MINIMUM THAT A GOOD HOSPITAL should do and they didn't even do that. If my husband hadn't been involved in the story, I would have been in crisis for much longer.SHAME!"

The hospital is large, cozy rooms, attentive nursing staff, specialists like Dr Fernando Flacker, Wonderful team, Dr Caio, Cardiology team, Dr Frederico Wonderful, but unfortunately the first PS doctor-patient care is terrible, unprepared doctors, doctors who respond bad, doctors who read medical records and tell the patient that he is a problem, even though he was due to a problem and even at the last consultation, they threaten to send me to the psychiatrist even though I already have this specialty and I have proper monitoring, you arrive at the PS the doctor is waiting for you with two three stones in his hands, he threatens to admit you to a psychiatrist, I discovered a short time ago in therapy, a psychologist and psychiatrist, a new diagnosis of mood disorder, but for the PS doctors the problem It's always that the patient is wrong, new doctors with no preparation at all, and unfortunately the hospital will have a bad reputation. From Geovane because the next time I go to this PS again and if I'm treated like honey or any other type of threatening treatment I'll be recording and I will file a lawsuit, the patient will not to the hospital because he's fine, he's going to get better, to have a decent diagnosis to be listened to and never disrespected.Guys, seeing here expressing my complete indignation with the hospital, I had an appointment with the cardio department on 10/30, and they always called me to let me know and confirm the appointment. I admit that I feel some prejudice, and in a way they don't want me to go to this hospital, I will make a very coherent complaint to the ANS Ee, including medical audios of me being mistreated. I was warned by a doctor in parentheses that my medical record is that of a problematic person and that is not to be said. I will take the appropriate measures and will not go to this hospital. I was in Os these days and I passed out in the street, I also hit my head, Uber was on trial and caught me with a crowd of people, I didn't even take a skull exam or the neurological assessment that the doctor promised he did, as he didn't lay a hand on me. It has already crossed all limits. I'm going to open an urgent complaint, this hospital has terrible service. ANS needs to know all the facts. I can no longer see the doctor I like, I'm going to look for another hospital. Run away from the lack of respect, run away from the lack of empathy that they talk about so much but don't use on a daily basis. Run away from the lack of humanization, run away from the pain and having to hear that it's normal and based on your diagnosis, that's exactly what you have to feel.Take a good look before entering this hospital, a hospital with a rating of 3.8 with international accreditation, well-established care protocols and you are treated poorly. Something wrong is happening. I missed the appointment on 11/30 with Dr Frederico, they don't care anymore to confirm. Please be careful."

Conselheiro Brotero, 1486 - Higienópolis, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Fabiano Prezia,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"A little over a year ago, I faced a kidney crisis due to a 4mm stone in the ureter, which led me to seek help at the emergency room at Hospital Samaritano, who referred me to a urologist on staff. Although my case was considered simple and common, this recommended professional managed to completely transform my year 2022 into a period of suffering. The future implications of this episode for my long-term health remain uncertain, but I already know that I am not the same as before when it comes to the health of my urinary system. After months of anguish at Hospital Samaritano under the care of this extremely inadequate doctor, I was forced to seek help at Hospital Albert Einstein to remedy the damage caused. I had to take this drastic and more costly measure to correct the mistakes made. In an attempt to better understand what happened, I requested recordings from the endoscopic cameras at Hospital Samaritano; such registration is standard practice in any health institution committed to seriousness or by genuinely dedicated and committed professionals. However, I was informed that no such recordings were available or even existed, as if they had inexplicably ""disappeared."" This situation only reflects the current state of Hospital Samaritano.PS: The process is underway, Hospital Samaritano."

It has turned into an eggshell, beautiful on the outside, but the inside may be rotten! When you're healthy, you don't play or gamble! I had the misfortune to break this eggshell, thinking it was the same hospital I used to go to years ago, and I found the inside to be rotten! I paid a huge price with my health for this!

Nurses are special. They took care of my husband with great care and dedication. The hospital food is horrible, the breakfast and afternoon coffee are great, the problem is the hospital kitchen has no talent for cooking. Some rooms have furniture falling apart, showers that only work with the shower head.One point that irritates companions is having to practice etiquette every time they leave and return from the hospital, often with a queue, for those who have been here for months it is very irritating. We had several systemic problems in relation to the prescription and application of medicines, as I am here 100% of the time I took several cases and involved the SAC several times, so if you have a family member here, always keep someone keeping an eye on everything. One point that could be improved is to remove Galeria dos Pães as a supplier. The products are of extremely low quality, like a fifth-rate bakery, and something so bad doesn't fit within Samaritano.

I was very well looked after by everyone. Extremely efficient hospitalization sector. I have a fantastic doctor (Dr. Rodolpho Truffa) who I met at the hospital clinic and who I recommend to everyone. However, I would like all the other doctors there to be inspired by Dr. Rodolpho, as he was the only one who made up for my trip to Samaritano. Last year I experienced many disappointments, but only today my cup overflowed. I had an appointment scheduled since the beginning of December 2022. The doctor canceled it and I understand that unforeseen events happen. The rescheduling was for a very distant date. I found it to be a lack of commitment to the patient, who waits so long and the hospital does not try to reschedule efficiently. I've waited this long and still wait more?! As if that wasn't enough, speaking on the phone with the responsible department, I made the review, waiting for a response and the attendant hung up the phone on me. I wasn't being rude, I still used the term ""I will provide constructive criticism"", but I was talking to myself. This isn't the first time this has happened, but today I didn't just decide to look for another place but rather expose what happened, since I've already had many other problems. Samaritano’s clinical care is leaving a lot to be desired. I would like all other doctors to have the same commitment as Dr. Rodolpho and for the other sectors to be as efficient as the inpatient sector."

The ""doctor"" after examinations, made the diagnosis: ""pneumonia"". They medicated him with tramal (analgesic) and dramin (against nausea) and prescribed antibiotics. That same night my wife's fever rose to 39 degrees. We return today, October 25, 2022. Another doctor, after more tests, reported that it was tonsillitis. She is hospitalized and only by God my wife seems to be improving. How can a person who studies for more than 6 years, does a residency, has access to all hospital exams and cannot differentiate pneumonia from tonsillitis? Where does this professional come from? What is this professional's academic background? What's the point of having access to all types of equipment and analyzes if the ""doctor"" doesn't know how to make a correct diagnosis? Should I report it as a medical error at CFM? Is it necessary for someone important to lose their life due to medical error?"

Hospital Samaritano,"R. Conselheiro Brotero, 1486 - Higienópolis, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",camila rodrigues,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",3 years ago,"Giving one star because unfortunately nothing less is possible!!!I had a consultation today with the pain group, Dr. ADRIANA MACARI CRM 17058, she changed a medication that I have been using for years, she wrote the wrong prescription (so far ok, everyone makes a mistake at some point in their life), I went to the pharmacy to try to buy it and I couldn't because it was on the wrong prescription.The biggest problem was trying to solve it, firstly, the hospital takes an absurd amount of time on line before you can get help, secondly, they are people who are totally UNPREPARED TO SOLVE THE MINIEST PROBLEMS!!!SIMONE, the telephone operator, was extremely rude and said that this problem is not her responsibility and that there was nothing she could do to help me, that I should go to the emergency room, detailing that I had JUST LEFT THERE, I got there at 1:17 pm and I left there at 6:17 pm, an ABSURD WAITING time. The doctor who treated me in the emergency room is EXCELLENT, as is Dr. ADRIANA from the pain team, the problem WAS NOT THE DOCTORS, although Dr. EDELVAN also wrote the wrong prescription, apparently this is a recurring problem for doctors at Samaritano .I just wanted a doctor to write the electronic prescription (which has already been authorized and widely used since the pandemic). Well, Simone transferred me to the emergency room because I really insisted that she do it, in the emergency room they transferred me to the nursing station, I was attended to by EDUARDA, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE POSITION. She asked me to wait because she would talk to the doctor, but before that she didn't even hear what I had to say and was still answering other people next door, leaving me talking alone and the call dropped.I called again and it went EXTREMELY FINEANSWERED by CAMILA TELEPHONE OFFICER, she was super kind and kept me on the line until I was answered and didn't run the risk of the call being dropped, UNFORTUNATELY I was answered again by EDUARDA, the most IMPROPER, RUDE, UNEDUCATIONAL person who DOESN'T KNOW EVEN BY FAR what WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE EMPATHY FOR A PERSON WHO 20 DAYS AGO ATTEMPTED SUICIDE AND STAYED 16 DAYS ADMITTED TO THE SAME HOSPITAL.She said that the doctor couldn't do anything, that I should go back to the emergency room even though I spent 5 hours there which is an absurd amount of time, or call on Monday to try to make an appointment with the doctor who wrote the prescription, detail this doctor only open on Fridays and until then I have to do without the medication, something simple to solve: AN ELECTRONIC PRESCRIPTION WITH THE MEDICATION THAT I ALREADY TAKE FOR CONTINUOUS USE AND YOU DO NOT NEED A BLUE RECIPE, JUST A SIMPLE 2-WAY RECIPE. but the hospital was NOT able to do anything to help a patient with a chronic illness.I would like to add one more addendum: of the entire pain team at Samaritano Higienopolis, Dr. ADRIANA MACARI is the best doctor on the team, in my opinion, of the 16 days I spent hospitalized she was the BEST (not that the others aren't, but she is incredible, she looks people in the eye, talks, sees the patient's real needs and tries to help in every way, she explains in a simple and easy way for a layman to understand, so much so that she suggested this modification precisely to HELP me since my return to my psychiatrist would not be for now, there was a mistake with the type of prescription, which I think is totally acceptable) the problem was how the hospital team behaved and treated the problem, not giving the slightest importance to the case.And to close this immense report that perhaps no one will read, I leave on record my INDIGNATION FOR THE CARE AND TREATMENT OF EDUARDA, responsible for the administration of the nursing station who, by the way, raised her voice several times and I had to ask for permission more than 3 times to try to talk because she DIDN'T LISTEN TO ME, SPEAKED OVER WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY AND DIDN'T RESOLVE IT, BUT DID NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE IT THE PROBLEM.I WILL REQUEST A RECORDING OF THE TWO CALLS AND RESOLVE ALL THIS DISORDER THEY MADE ME THROUGH LEGAL MEANS."

I came in pregnant, with difficulty breathing, chest pain and scared to death of being there, exposed.10:41 was when I entered, there were no two people in the waiting room: which didn't stop me from waiting almost 1 hour (exactly 50 minutes) to be seen, preferably: the waiting room was empty (see photo) not a soul. The doctor carried out tests: blood, electrocardiogram, GO assessment and x-ray and the saga continues: 1 nurse who did the electro but couldn't do the blood because it was ordered for the artery: he called his colleague 4 times, and 1 hour later no blood was taken ( and I was already waiting close to 3 hours, alone). The handsome guy came and literally ripped open two veins, and the one he got with the help of his colleague hurt a lot, it swelled too much and he still couldn't collect it all: he left me for another colleague. 1pm: shift changes and a blessed woman attends me (I was already freaking out from hunger and tiredness) and takes the blood. X-ray: I was already leaving without treatment, they convinced me it was important. I stayed there crying and another hour for the doctor to authorize - after all, he didn't even realize that I was pregnant and should be authorized. I left that hell well after 3pm. The doctor? He said: “yes, probably COVID, if it gets worse, look for a PA” I didn’t have the strength to even look at him.  We're at home: I'm having trouble breathing, physically and emotionally exhausted. Ademir, who went to the most serious ward: he took the COVID test, he listened to his lung in 5 seconds, he didn't do a blood test, he didn't do a CT scan or x-ray: he administered a dipyrone and dismissed him. And here we are: he's burning with fever, shaking next to me and I can barely speak because of so much pain in my lungs and difficulty breathing. Everything will be fine: for now, nothing is fine.Note: the next day we went to the Nipo Brasileiro Hospital, and Ademir was admitted: 20% pulmonary involvement. 5 days of hospitalization and oxygen, the day after walking out Samaritan's front door."

Meanwhile, in all the time I was waiting, they called exactly 6 people for unscheduled exams, like my appointment.I had to leave and come back another day because the fasting time exceeded twelve hours. The attendants at counters 14,15,16 who are close to the room that serves coffee after the exams, perhaps because they are separated from the others, are talking about personal matters when they should be concentrating on the service and calling people for assistance, I was close to these counters, but there is no supervisor around to supervise the service.I returned on December 1, 2020 to carry out the exams and it took around 1h15min to open the form again, after the form was opened everything went as normal and on time.This first service got absurdly worse and no one there can explain why. What is happening in this great hospital is regrettable, the board needs to resolve this serious problem.After many years of using the services provided with excellence by this hospital, I want to express my dissatisfaction with the initial service that I believe will be resolved by the administration of this renowned establishment.I still give you 5 stars."

The first time, a horrible doctor who was more like a horse with the child, grabbed the child with such brutality that it scared my not-yet-year-old baby. The baby started crying nonstop, and that's why she diagnosed it with MENINGITIS, just because the child was crying. He carried out several tests and all of them were negative, but he still hospitalized and isolated the child. She took liquor from her spine, and even though it was negative, she continued to say it was meningitis. In the end, another doctor evaluated it and called an ENT, it was simply the hand-foot-and-mouth virus. We were hospitalized for 3 days for nothing, apart from the desperation that this doctor was causing terror to us. The other two times he was diagnosed as a simple virus and in reality it was otitis in both ears, and he needed to take antibiotics. THE CHILDREN'S PS IS TERRIBLE."

They carried out all the necessary procedures to effectively resolve the problem, and everything very quickly. We took a shift change at night. In all the ERs I've been to, when there's a shift change, the service becomes chaos and the patient ends up in limbo from the previous shift. Not at Samaritano. Employees were able to continue their service as normal.Given these characteristics, I understand why the queue for service is so long.

Nobody knew anything, it took them hours to tell me what exams I had to take, I didn't know if they would do the exam or not. They didn't know anything. Everything I asked, including the pediatrician who attended to my daughter, who didn't look at our eyes at any time (I don't think she even saw my face, as she didn't look at me or my husband at any time). some), they did not know how to answer.

After the procedure, they informed me that they would take my son to bed 5 in the ER to await removal. When we arrived at the ER, the nurse said that there was no such bed as it is a virtual bed. I was very nervous and they placed us in the procedure room, without any type of assistance and with children coming in and out all the time to do procedures alongside my son.As the ambulance was not expected to arrive to take us home, I had to call my husband and risk going home by car, even as my son had been fasting since 10 am and it was already 11 pm and apparently we were going to stay for a long time in that situation without assistance.We left Samaritano without a discharge summary, without anyone even realizing we were leaving.

We went to this hospital because of the medical team that specialized in BMT, however, it was not enough to save the life of my mother who passed away, not from Leukemia, but from cardiac arrest due to excess potassium!?!?

The second exam was all wrong, they scheduled it, they contacted me asking for the guide again, they would direct me to another sector. The next day they asked to get in touch again to confirm the exam. In the end, they canceled the exam because they got confused and it was not covered by the insurance plan. The first exam was scheduled, the preparations were confirmed and sent (everything ok until then), when I arrived for the exam at the scheduled time I received the information that there was an error in the system saying that my insurance company does not have a contract for the exam. The attendant asks me to wait, the result: I arrived at 1:50 pm for the exam at 2:15 pm and I waited until 3:00 pm and managed to take the exam.
