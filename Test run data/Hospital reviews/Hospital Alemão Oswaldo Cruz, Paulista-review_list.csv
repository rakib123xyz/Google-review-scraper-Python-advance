Once in the exam room, no one provided me with the questionnaire in advance and it took a few more minutes for a questionnaire to be brought in and it to be filled out. The exam itself didn't even last 10 minutes. I thought the wait was over, it was another 10 minutes looking for an attendant at the ticket window to request my vehicle."

What a disappointment.I decided to try at Oswaldo Cruz, there they advised me to ask at tower A, at the reception of that tower they didn't know if they received it or not, but one of the employees went to find out and came back saying yes, and that I could leave it there and he would forward it.      Too bad I didn't ask his name.I would like to record my thanks, we want to do the correct disposal, but most laboratories don't make it easy, on the contrary (I had already tried at a Delboni close to my house and they said I should take the specific unit, which is out of hand for me)."

It was super sensitive.When she was admitted, everyone from the x-ray, tomography, nurses and gastroenterology team was exemplary.First time I've been hospitalized... doctors in the area (in my case).I've already had a colonic exam and an opaque enema.

However, the night staff are mostly very rude.At this moment my father is almost 80 years old, has advanced Parkinson's, has dementia, is sleeping and a girl comes in, shining a light in her face, talking loudly and complaining. I asked him not to wake him up and turn on the indirect lights, out of respect for his age, so as not to scare him or agitate him. She tells me “I’m not going to medicate in the dark”. I said that the lights in the hallway and on the side of the bed illuminated the room and didn't make anything dark and I also commented that he doesn't take medication at this time. She turns around and says “if I don’t go now it will be late because I have other rooms”.So does this mean that my father has to bring his medications forward by 1 hour due to team disorganization?Result: he woke up, shook and is groaning.Why treat a patient like that? Even older. What a lack of humanity, my God"

The procedure was scheduled for 8am, and we arrived promptly at 7am. I was told it would be quick, however, after waiting 2 and a half hours, I decided to ask what was going on. I was informed that the doctor had been late and that the patient had just come in for the procedure – it was already after 10:30 am.As I am only a companion and not a close relative, I will need to make up these working hours, as my certificate will not be accepted. The delay caused me great inconvenience, as now I will have to make up for this time at work. Additionally, during the time I waited, I observed several other people waiting for long periods to be served.

If you want to stay like this, just go to this hospital. They don’t know how to place a venous access without hurting your vein, they don’t know how to perform an intravenous infusion… There is a nurse with a tattooed arm, who will make you go through a unique experience: She comes in, says she needs to “clean your vein” and then administers a syringe full of serum at once very quickly into your venous access, she wants to see you feel pain. And your arm will look like the one in the photo. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE."

The agreement was for me to leave the room by 12:00 on 08/19, but I had to wait for my husband to get off work to come and pick me up. When it was close to noon, a nurse came into the room, pressuring me to follow the schedule and said that if I didn't leave by 12:00, she would have to charge me another night's stay. Explain to her that I was waiting for my husband to come and pick me up because I couldn't walk.... When it was close to noon a nurse came and put me in a wheelchair and amazingly! He left me sitting on a wooden bench outside by the parking lot waiting for my husband to arrive. I had to get out of the wheelchair by myself and sit on the wooden bench. Detail, I had surgery on both legs and I had very little mobility. As if that wasn't enough, they didn't ask me to sign any discharge. To make matters even worse, they sent me an email saying that I overstayed by 1:30 hours inside the surgical center and they are charging me almost R$2,000 for that! Wait... It's not my fault! I paid to use the hospital in advance and I was anesthetized, how could I know if I was exceeding the operating room usage time! Who is responsible? From the hospital? From the doctor? I just know that mine isn't!Absurd negligence! I do not recommend this hospital to anyone!I still forgot to mention above that I didn't even receive lunch on the day of discharge!"

He felt ill because as he was preparing for the urinary tract examination he had to have a full bladder, apart from the prolonged period of fasting.When being seen by a fellow doctor, he reported whether my mother was transgender, as it was specified in the service opening form. Now let's get to the factsI pay Bradesco insurance for my mother. Nothing cheap for better quality service. I'm not talking about dignified care because that's the minimum we have to have in medical care, regardless of whether it's private or public.Now the hospital did not have any kind of empathy, dignified care, prudence towards my motherI'm a doctor crm 147847, orthopedist rqe 56471, I've operated at Osvaldo Cruz, I know the hospital's service but I really don't recommend it to anyone or any other fellow doctor today.To treat patients like my mother was treated, I prefer to go to other hospital referencesPerhaps the closure of the Vergueiro unit was due to the low level of adherence to your service, since from the looks of it and from other Google comments the service is rubbish, terrible, not worthy of a medical service where even the slightest thing you can do is the medical/hospital empathyA shame!!!!"

I carried out all the consultations with normal coverage, and the time came to schedule the surgery, the doctor took my contact information so that his secretary could contact me. She got in touch and requested my documents via WhatsApp (which is against LGPD legislation, but that's ok, thinking about scheduling the procedure soon, I provided my details) and then got back to me saying that the plan would cover everything except the medical fees that should be paid privately, an amount of R$ 20,000.00 reais, I immediately refused, as I have insurance and it would not make sense for me to pay the doctor and the agreement to pay the rest, without taking into consideration that 20,000.00 is not 20 reais, nor 200.00 reais, it is a very high amount.Now comes the question, does Oswaldo Cruz Hospital have professionals and a policy like this, to say the least predatory, without respect and without ethics, as I had been seeing the doctor for 4 months, I lost 15 kilos to carry out the surgical procedure, I prepared myself, I created expectation and simply in the final stretch, without any respect for the person, I am informed that I would have to pay 20,000.00 to perform the surgery, I felt extorted, where an institution with its professionals creates a favorable atmosphere and then takes advantage of the moment of vulnerability to extort the person to pay for part of the procedure privately.Oswaldo Cruz Hospital should act and ensure that its accredited professionals are ethical and respect patients, could the doctor inform me that he would have to pay privately during the first consultation or in the worst case scenario simply say that there is no coverage and leave it to my discretion to ask or express the desire, if applicable, to do so in a particular way.With this predatory attitude I believe that there are people who can do even what they cannot do to get the money due to the entire context created by the Hospital, I already think about this end.

I am being disrespected by doctors and nurses. Doctors with aEgo up there and arrogant nurses. Since I arrived here they told me that they would admit me to investigate my pain, and the doctor named Wares said he would order a more complete examination and even said on the 3rd floor where I was as there was no room as they said the hospital was crowded, he said that I was taking morphine and that it wasn't for the pain I was having and that it was addictive and he always gave me the morphine. When I came to the room, only things happened that made me more emotionally stressed and did nothing to improve my symptoms and that same doctor was called and he said that I was lying, that he never ordered that exam and that I wasn't going to do it and that he never talked about the medicine morphine. Afterwards, I was treated poorly by a nurse and the nurse asked me to buy my insulins as they were not available at the hospital. Today I had low blood sugar, I called for them and they weren't coming, I screamed and no one came, when a girl who arrived with dinner arrived and I asked to call the nurse, then the nurse arrived and said she couldn't do anything because It took a while because I was talking to a companion, and I said but low blood sugar can cause a coma, so I might as well die waiting, then I asked the nutritionist to bring something with sugar and they refused and the nurse came to the room and I said look, look at me I said I want only be treated by women nurses, because I had called the ombudsman and communicated before and they promised me that it would only be nurses because I don't feel comfortable, and I said I have low blood sugar and everything came on a diet and I needed to eat something to get it up and it was thick He said if you want, you can eat, if you don't want to eat, don't eat either, in a rude tone. Then he said he didn't come because he didn't hear the bell but then I asked why he was in the room if I asked men not to come then he said he heard the bell, then one moment he didn't hear another cry, did he? They lie to their facesI had a bad nightThey gave me some medicine that made me wake up every 3 minutes screaming in panicThen they called a doctor who prescribed me some medicine and sent me to the ICU.Then I took the other one she prescribed and I was allergic all night and still had the symptom of waking up every 3 minutes feeling drowsy and panicking.So much so that today I only sleptThey are giving me tramal and several strong medications all the time and if I say that it is strong and that it doesn't solve the pain and I decide not to take it, they say that I am refusing and depending on the doctor, he says that I refuse, so I am acceptingI'm not in the hospital because I want toThe pains are realI have never seen a hospital treat patients like this and my mother has seen other people complainThere is no point in saying that not taking action and doing nothingThere is no point in deleting my report in the complaint hereYou are wrongThis is medical violenceBecause of one of your doctors, my mother left the hospital and the doctor said she just had gas and anxiety and she came home and went to another hospital on the same day and had surgery on the same day and has a colostomy bagIncompetent doctorsI fear for my physical integrity and that of my motherI'm afraid of certain doctors and nursesI'm afraid they'll kill meMay I have consequences for not taking care of me properlyThe exam should have been ordered on timeNot to go to the extreme of calling an ombudsmanMy right is to be able to take exams and know what I haveI'm not freeYou are not doing me any favors"

I arrived at 5:00 am and the nursing team on that shift treated me very well. Well, after the surgery I went to the room. After a few hours of arriving in the room, I started itching, at first I thought it was my allergic rhinitis. At that moment, since we rang the bell and no one came, my niece, who was accompanying me, went to the nurses and explained what was happening, and asked if I could take the medicine I was used to taking, and the nurses said that Yes. When my niece returned, she informed me that the nurse named Jessica had given her a very bad reception, which she responded with impatience. But, as the moment was not conducive to further discussions, we left it aside. However, a few hours later, my itching intensified and my face swelled. Once again my niece went to the nursing department to report what was happening. At that moment, the nurse named Jessica, rudely, without turning on the light to see that my face was swollen and red, standing in the hallway of the room, said in a harsh tone: “That's just how it is, it's an effect on the spinal cord. ” and walked away, without noticing that I looked bad. Only in the morning, when the nursing technician named Olga entered the room and took the time to turn on the room light, did she see that something was wrong. At that moment she said she was going to call the doctor on duty to see me. The super sweet doctor came in and when she saw me she said I had a drug allergy. At that point, she spoke to my doctor and gave me the correct medication and stopped another medication that could have caused this allergy. So, after Lipedema surgery, I spent the whole night without sleeping, not because of the surgery, but because of the allergy that the nursing team from the night of 14/06 to 15/06 was unable to detect, as they were unable to look at me and listen to me so that they could take some action. But it didn't end there, the next morning, when I was discharged, I asked: I need to leave in a wheelchair, right?, the nurse replied: Only if you want”. Well, if it's up to me I never use a wheelchair, but in all the surgeries I've had I always leave the hospital in a wheelchair. With that said, I walked out of the hospital. When I arrived in the taxi that was waiting for me outside the hotel, as he is already used to picking up post-surgical patients, he was surprised. Note that my hospitalization was private, but even if it wasn't, no person can go through what I went through.  I came from Rio de Janeiro to undergo surgery in São Paulo, and I honestly thought the situation would be much better. I reported all this to my doctor."

It is worth mentioning that just to see the doctor there was more than 2 hours of waiting, the only quick part was the medication and exam collection. They informed me that it would take 1h30 for the exams to be ready, but that I could follow them through the app, the exams only became available the following day. To my surprise, when I looked at the reports, they were all ready in less than 45 minutes, however, they called me 1h30 after collection to return with the doctor. The dengue test was positive, the doctor gave the instructions and asked me to return to the PS on Monday (20/05/2024), monitor the platelets, which were a little low, and for me to make an appointment at the dengue clinic to Wednesday, for the same reason. I was optimistic because I thought they would give priority to those who already have a positive diagnosis for dengue, but I was wrong. Today is the 20th and right now I'm waiting for more than 2 hours in the ER and I haven't even seen the doctor, that is, I haven't even taken the exam that is so important to monitor the risk of bleeding. I tried to fit in at the dengue clinic and to my surprise there was only an appointment for 06/24/24. I couldn't find an appointment to go to the dengue clinic today and save myself from spending hours in the ER just to do a blood count, I couldn't make an appointment for the 22nd as recommended by the doctor. So this dengue clinic apparently serves no purpose. They do not prioritize anyone who is suffering so much from Dengue symptoms. On Saturday I spent 5 hours in the PS, today I've been there for almost 3 hours and only God knows when I'll get out of here. I don't even live near this hospital, I came because of its reputation and having had positive experiences in the past. Now I don't recommend it, I understand that there is a high demand, but the hospital has to adapt to this and not leave the patient waiting for hours in a reception, with water that tastes horrible.

Detail: the companion's food was not included and I was not notified, so at 6pm I asked the nurses and also at reception, who said that the patient's food and the companion's food would already arrive. When it was 9:30 pm the patient's food arrived and I was informed that the companion's food was not included in the patient's health plan. Absurd!!! I asked for a nurse to stay in the room while I went down to the restaurant to eat, but they said they couldn't stay there. The patient had undergone orthognathic surgery and he wasn't talking, so it was very difficult, he needed to have someone there 24 hours a day. The nurses told me that I could go eat and that if he needed he could press the button and the nurse would go to him, MAAAAS every time I needed to press the button, no one ever showed up in less than 10 minutes, so if he needed someone urgently , apparently he died right there!!!!At 9:30 pm I went down for dinner, the restaurant kitchen was already closed (it closes at 9 pm), I had to leave the hospital, where right on the door was the announcement: BE CAREFUL, HIGH RISK OF ROBBERY AT THIS PLACE!!What is the point of a patient needing a companion, given that for the companion to eat, they have to leave the room (since the hospital does not offer room service) and a nurse cannot stay with the patient during the period? AN ABSURD!Total lack of information regarding the companion's nutrition!!!!About the doctor: The doctor was wonderful, but she wasn't a hospital doctor, she was private, otherwise it would also be bad, just like the rest of the service provided.The only thing I can say that was good was the admission reception, that's all!!!"

I filed a dispute with SAC, I was not answered, but they sent me a new invoice with a small discount. My biggest complaint is regarding the financial/billing department, TERRIBLE service. I had to call the department countless times asking for the payment link, as I don't live in São Paulo, I often didn't get an answer, I tried again. When it was answered, they did not recognize the new bill sent by SAC. They transferred the call, called until it dropped. I sent several emails to the address provided, with no response.

I was forced to go and breastfeed my 3-month-old son hidden in the parking lot, because they threatened me with evasion if they called me.Today I stayed 2:30 to take medication in an EMPTY PS. Nurses blaming the doctor for the delay, claiming that she did things outside of protocol, or that I was called for medication and didn't respond. One blaming the other, inventing an excuse every hour in the ward. The culmination was telling me that there was no stretcher available for me to take the medication lying down as the doctor requested. The armchair does not recline and does not have a footrest to minimize the situation and control my low blood pressure. A shame, lack of respect, organization and transparency. I reached my limit and 5 hours later I left still in pain.Run away from this PS. Years come and go and this mess continues."

I called and was answered by an operator named Anésia who showed complete unpreparedness and lack of empathy.I reported that I had an appointment at the hospital's PA on 10/11. At the time, he had strong flu symptoms (fever, body aches, runny nose). I was seen by Dr. Anita Cristina who sent me for a radiological examination and Covid test. Shortly after the exams, I returned to the office and was informed that the X-ray was normal and I received a prescription for flu-like symptoms. I was also informed that the Covid test result would be out within 24 hours. Yesterday the result came out and it was ""positive"".Last night 12/10 I noticed that I had a little pain in my chest and this morning I felt unwell and had a fever.I then decided to contact the hospital in an attempt to speak to Dr Anita Cristina.When I was explaining what happened (in the way I'm reporting it above) I was interrupted by the operator, aggressively and rudely, saying that, over the phone, I wouldn't be able to speak to the doctor and that if I wanted to, I should go to another appointment.I work in the health sector and this is not the attitude we expect from an attendant. I understand the rules of a hospital, but the way they are transmitted to its users, especially like what happened to me, should be totally different.The front line (reception, CALLER, attendants) should be as well qualified as medical professionals.This is my record and my contempt for the treatment received.CLAUDIO NASCIMENTO DE OLIVEIRA"

Fogaça de Barros.On September 1, 2023, I underwent emergency surgery due to acute inflammation of the appendix and a developing umbilical hernia. The severe abdominal pain was quickly diagnosed, and the decisive action of the medical team was essential for my recovery.Dr. Paulo Fogaça demonstrated not only his medical expertise, but also his ability to make quick and accurate decisions. In addition to removing the appendix, the resolution of the umbilical hernia was performed masterfully, avoiding future complications.I want to express my deep gratitude not only to Dr. Paulo Fogaça, but also to all the members of the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital team, whose dedication and professionalism were remarkable. My experience with this exemplary medical team left me impressed and grateful.Thank you for providing exceptional care in a time of great need. My recovery is progressing well, thanks to the talent and dedication of all of you. Once again, thank you very much."

Horrible food, if I hadn't contacted the nursing team several times, my discharge wouldn't have been possible since I had already completed all the post-operative procedures.But the worst of all was receiving an undue charge in the amount of R$4,800 one month after the surgery, even though the entire procedure was authorized and covered by the health plan.So far the bill is in my name and Oswaldo Cruz doesn't resolve it in the email exchange, the billing, SAC and ombudsman have been copied and still no one takes a stand (only SAC sent me a protocol which so far hasn't worked nothing, it's been more than 2 months since I had the operation).I am not an isolated case of undue billing, a friend's father had the problem for a month. For this reason I do not recommend this hospital, be warned... I have had procedures done in other hospitals and never had any problems, but at Oswaldo Cruz for the first and last time."

I imagined that the pattern would be replicated to other Units.But unfortunately, I wasn't so lucky. Yesterday (28/07/23) I arrived at the Hospital before 4:00 pm, the procedure would be at 6:00 pm.I went to pre-surgery at around 5pm and almost at 6pm, my doctor managed to locate me, as they couldn't tell her where I was.We talked, I signed the terms, the anesthesiologist arrived, we talked, I signed the terms. All they had to do was call me to the Surgical Center, and nothing! Almost 7pm, they took me.A simple procedure scheduled for 6:00 pm only took place at 7:30 pm, due to the fact that there was no anesthetist, no one knew when one would arrive. It was a ""talk-talk""... nobody knew anything. I saw that there was a guy trying to solve it, but in the end, it really delayed, something so simple. And all ""planted"" in the room.Of course, I started to feel anxious and my blood pressure changed, making me more distressed. =(It was something simple that ended up making me really nervous. As a layman, we start to think a thousand things, will the person who arrives rush through the anesthesia? I consider it disrespectful to leave other professionals alone, my doctor had other commitments.Anyway, in the end everything worked out, but I believe I didn't need to go through that. Delay, lack of communication and the problem described above. I hope I don't need it, but I DO NOT intend to return to this unit.>>> I would like to note that ALL employees are kind and polite!!! Even the anesthesiologist who arrived later was very attentive and everything went well. A SPECIAL compliment to MARCOS, who is an assistant at the Surgical Center, always worried about me, making me feel comfortable. <<<"

But the doctor didn't believe me, he said it was muscle pain and prescribed me paracetamol tablets. Furthermore, after contacting the hospital's ombudsman, I discovered that the doctor prescribed me anti-inflammatories, a medicine that I am allergic to and I had informed this during the screening and also to the doctor.Inside the hospital I asked THREE nurses to speak to the doctor to prescribe me some other medicine, as I was in a lot of pain. The doctor just ignored me. I left the hospital of my own free will, to seek care at another hospital, given the hospital's refusal to provide care.In another hospital where I sought care, a kidney stone was found requiring SURGERY to remove the stone, while at Oswaldo Cruz Hospital, after contacting the ombudsman, it was announced that the diagnosis would be pyelonephritis (a disease that did not exist). In other words, if I had remained in the hospital I would still be in pain and would still be treated incorrectly, for an illness that I was not suffering from.I have already requested the medical record via email to take the necessary measures and so far I have been ignored."

Yesterday (11/11/22) my experience shattered ""my belief"". We arrived at 4:45pm at the Emergency Room and my son's password was CM65 and they were calling CM 61. The expected service time on the panel was 1:37am for the Medical Clinic, that is, ok for a PA.Passing the screening took an hour and then went to the registry, but the doctor never called. After another 1:30 hours waiting to call my son (he was in a lot of pain) I spoke to a member of staff and he speeded up the service... but then came the first disappointment: my son was being discharged without having seen a doctor!!! ! AMAZINGThe doctor ordered some tests and he already knew it would take time. He returned from CT at 8pm and at 10:30pm they still hadn't called him back. I talked to a nurse and he checked that the tests were ready. 1 hour later they still hadn't called. We had already been in the Emergency Room for 7 hours, without eating absolutely anything, and unfortunately I had to fight for my son to be seen, as there were 3 doctors attending to him and the PA was NOT full. We left the hospital at 11:55 pm!!!Conclusion: if you don't fight, you won't be attended to, as they either discharge you from the screening process or forget about those arriving at the front. You really left disappointed!"

Great service.To get to the block, very well signposted on the ground.Nursing team on the 7th floor, very attentive: Fabiana, Valéria, Beatriz and Alex.The room is very comfortable, with a sofa bed and the difference is a balcony with blinds that operate automatically.Also in the room, they have a digital safe, minibar (not stocked) and television with a network of pay channels such as HBO, Telecine, as well as a board with all the information about the patient and care team.Bathroom equipped with safety bars and bath chair.Super recommended.Appropriate meals, according to the type of diet. I requested an extra meal in the early hours of the morning, as I hadn't had dinner after the procedure, and I was served without any problems.I went back to edit the review, because today, 24 days after carrying out the surgical procedure, I received a billing email informing me that I was late with payment. I found it strange, since I was hospitalized under my health plan, so it wasn't a private hospitalization.At the admission reception, we are given several pieces of paper to sign, including some pages of items that, according to the attendant, some plans do not cover. Values ​​from absorbent to other items. Products with symbolic values ​​from R$0.09 to much higher values.Among all the papers, to finalize your entry into hospitalization, you must sign all of them.When I received a return email from the Hospital's billing area, which I questioned what it was about, I was only informed today, after questioning, that my plan did not offer coverage for leg braces R$ 674.72 + anti sock thrombosis R$ 224.00 + blue magnet box with needle counter R$ 0.01 (yes, charge of R$ 0.01 one cent of reais), totaling R$ 898.73.At no point were we informed that my plan did not offer coverage for these items, much less did they go to the room to speak to my companion or even less upon hospital discharge did the nurse or anyone else inform us about these charges.Ok, the plan does not offer coverage for any item, but the Hospital has an obligation to inform the patient in advance of billing.The amounts they are charging me are relatively “low”, as they are just two items, but there could be a few more digits and there could be other items that the plan would not cover and I would simply be caught by surprise with a charge for something that I was not charged. informed.I was disappointed with the hospital's communication, which until then, I had found everything wonderful and had rated it as a 5, because of that, it dropped to a 3."

When I arrive at the counter there is no one to collect my guides, I press the bell and wait (there is a note asking me to press it just once and wait) so I did, but I was unable to do so, I pressed it 3 times and nothing, I was waiting for more than 20 minutes until someone appeared, who just took my form and asked me to wait, by which time it was already 10 am! I continued waiting to be served, it was packed with people there. In the end, they called me at approximately 11am, I thought it was disrespectful towards the patient, mainly because we were ABSOLUTELY FASTING.

The first impression I had of the hospital was that of being in a trawler or a bus station. I already got lost. The signage is bad and so are the logistics. You can see many people disoriented through the maze corridors. Employees only know their own workplace. You ask and they don't know anything beyond the door itself (and they even gave me wrong information). The person who provided me with correct information was the doorman/guard who organizes the car entrance guard. I had to stop in front of a map to understand the organization of the hospital. Finally, when I found the specialty center I was looking for, I was well attended to. They look like islands: there are several small hospitals within a large hospital (at the main turnstile, where I entered, they didn't even know where my doctor worked). The doctor who treated me was wonderful! Afterwards, I went to Block A to schedule the exams. The attendant in the exam scheduling area didn't know where Laboratory A+ was (I decided to find it on my own, but I decided to do it at Hospital Santa Catarina, as it is more organized and the service is better). The exam I needed to schedule would be available in 7 days (of course I went to schedule the exam at Hospital Santa Catarina, which offered me a schedule the next day). I didn't like the experience. Good thing the doctor “saved” it. I prefer Hospital Santa Catarina, which is opposite. Please do not ask me to contact the ombudsman. Everything you need to improve is said there. Thanks."

To finish the exam I took, it was not posted on the website and therefore, today I have to go to another hospital again to retake the exam.

And again a lot of delay. Almost 1 hour to go through screening. PA full (management is not keeping up with the demand). The medical team was very friendly and attentive, but they were unable to diagnose effectively. And the doctor himself told her to look for the Santa Joana PA, as there is no Gynecology and Obstetrics specialist in the emergency room at Oswaldo Cruz. In other words, pregnant women. Not to mention that, a few months ago, they missed a CT scan carried out for my mother and, after a lot of arguments, they sent a xerox of the report by motorcycle courier, they lost the scan... and the people in the sector didn't know each other, They didn't know who to look for, who picked it up and did the exam... the hospital is revealing management failures.The Hospital's Emergency Care fell in quality. I accompanied my PREGNANT wife with severe nausea for days without being able to eat and hydrate due to severe nausea. It took 15 min. for screening and a little more to be attended to. The doctor prescribed serum, but it took almost 40 minutes. for the infirmary to apply the serum. They also said that an obstetrician at the hospital would speak to her. But it didn't come. He finished the serum and then said that he would only remove the access when he was discharged. But there was no communication at all, I would be stuck waiting for hours to be discharged. We went to the doctor's room and then he verbally discharged us, we went to the infirmary and said he discharged us and only then removed the access. Internal communication processes need to improve.During the wait, I noticed dozens of people in the PA complaining that they had been waiting for more than an hour just to pass the screening. They hadn't even received the risk assessment bracelets. The lack of nurses and attendants on site was very evident. My wife said that when she arrived, there wasn't even anywhere to sit. The hospital could offer more care to meet the high demand. Otherwise, you will start to lose customers."

I WAS WRONG...IF IT WASN'T FOR THE EXTREME DELAY IN SERVICE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM, all you had to do was read the countless complaints about it and search the comments on GOOGLE... I WAS SHOCKED BY THE BELOW LEVEL OF SUS in terms of quality of care...MY REASON FOR GOING TO THE PS: approximately 2 days ago before going to this BUTCHER SHOP called HOSPITAL FAMOSO OSWLADO CRUZ, I hit my head on the corner of a wooden table, at the time it hurt a lot, burning pain to the point of checking to see if I had bled .. which didn't happen... However, even taking a painkiller at home, doing the basics that any creature with a brain would do... I realized that the pain didn't lessen and added to that I presented craving attacks...Still, I waited to see if what didn't happen would happen... and so I did what any NORMAL person would do... I DECIDED TO GO TO THE ER TO RULE OUT ANY SERIOUS THING...---------------------------- PS SERVICE:After waiting for an hour in the ER, I was seen, the doctor in question heard from me EXACTLY what I describe in this text, he sat me down on the stretcher and examined me quickly and after spending about 7 minutes in silence looking at the computer, here's the verdict:""LOOK, I'M TALKING TO YOU AND LOOKING ABOUT YOU, SEEING THAT YOU'RE WELL ORIENTED, I THINK EVERYTHING IS OKAY! IN GENERAL, EVERY DOCTOR REQUESTS A TOMOGRAPHY RIGHT AWAY (I said OBVIOUSLY, can I go and do it now?) he, the butcher doctor, said: but in these married due to mild trauma, I don't see the need for a CT scan, you're fine, you're young, the cancer is there, why take radiation ..."" he concluded, embarrassed by his own explanation...BUT... he continued, THE FILTHY DOCTOR: so you don't miss your trip, I can give you what we have here: TYLENOL or NOVALGINA...YES GENTLEMEN, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED INSIDE THE PS OF OSWALDO CRUZ HOSPITAL....-------------------------I was so shocked, so disgusted that I looked at my husband who was vomiting in disgust at this BUTCHER, I mean DOCTOR...I could barely respond... HOWEVER I thought it best NOT TO DEMAND, YES WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND FROM THE DOCTOR WHAT BRINGS US SAFETY... because I saw that he was an AMATEUR...He insisted that I take TYLENOL, I pretended to have dementia, I put it in my mouth and spat in the lobby itself.,,WE LEFT THERE RUNNING SHOCKED WITH THE CERTAINTY OF NEVER GOING TO STEP THERE AGAIN... FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHINGDETAIL: from there we went to another PS... and yes, the DOCTOR, before even talking, said:""LOOK IN THESE CASES OF TRAUMA, LIGHT MEDIUM OR SEVERE, NO DOCTOR CAN SAY OR SAY ANYTHING WITHOUT A TOME IN HAND... he sent me straight to a CT scan...""--------------------------------------------------OSWALDO CRUZ HOSPITAL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE INSTITUTION BUT FROM THE LEVEL OF COMPLAINTS YOU ONLY HAVE FAME BECAUSE THE LEVEL IS WORSE THAN SUS...I DEMAND RETRACTION... I WILL REPORT THE DOCTOR'S CRM, I WILL MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT AN ILLEGAL RULE THAT OBLIGES THE DOCTOR TO CONTINUE EXAMINATIONS ACCORDING TO THE PLAN... AND WITHIN THE LAW, IF THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THIS TRASH SERVICE, I will take all appropriate legal action.YOU ARE TERRIBLE YOU ONLY HAVE A NAME...

But the bathroom had a musty and strong smell. I asked for an ice pack to put on the knee of the companion who was in pain and they said it couldn't be done. How absurd an ice pack is. And around 1 am the employees were talking loudly and the employees were taking out the trash. Not this early in the morning, right?  The operated patient was unable to sleep.  I thought the hospital was better... the attentive nurses did. But otherwise, there is much to be desired. Ah, the patient asked for a coffee at 7pm and we are still waiting....."

Terrible!!! Terrible!!!What's worse is after you've undergone a surgical procedure it looks like you're begging for a bowl of soup...but no!!!It is due to a lack of respect for the patient, for the person, dehumanized care!"
