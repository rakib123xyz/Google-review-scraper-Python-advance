I accompanied my girlfriend to an emergency room because of some pain she was feeling! After a CT scan, they asked us to wait for the results, which were already in the hands of the doctors! After waiting for almost 2 hours, I had to go and complain about the delay in getting the service going.After the CT scan we asked if we could come back later to see the results as it was already early in the morning and we were hungry and tired!  But they made us wait for almost two hours in an uncomfortable chair in one of the most renowned hospitals!Good thing I have a different health plan!I followed other patients who sought care and the poor service provided was clear!"

We are not asking for exemption from the charge, but rather common sense of values. HELP"

My daughter Rafaela on 10/29/2024 had a 12-hour video-electroencephalogram exam.. By Dr Eliana Garzon's Team. A specialized team for Autistic people. On 10/26/2024, Dr Eliana Garzon and Nurse Alessandra. They contacted me to find out what Rafaela was like and what she liked, so that the hospital stay could be more pleasant for Rafaela. On the day of the admission of the receptionist, the receptionist who admitted us to the hospital was very well looked after. When we went to the room, the Doctor on duty was very patient, Dr Gustavo Mercenas dos Santos, Nurse Erick was the first to see how to measure pressure, see temperature, etc. Rafaela is 4 years old and we always go to doctors and do exams and for her it is torture. But this Nurse Erick was great 💓, by the way. All the nurses during Rafaela's hospitalization were wonderful, very patient and very professional. Thank you so much for caring for my daughter Rafaela.

(Since I had ""passed"" the second stage) I would have accepted not having passed the second or third stage (if I had done the 3rd), but they made me believe and wait (FOR ALMOST 2 WEEKS), to the end hadn't even passed, I thought it was a lack of respect towards me, the interviews were very calm, the first stage I did the interview alone (but there were supposed to be more people) in the second stage I did it with 3 more candidates, the interviewers were great, at least Google I didn't see anyone commenting on this subject (having done an interview with them) so I'm just going to talk about this subject, thank you for the little chance you gave me, that this doesn't happen again, making the candidate wait for a long time, only to receive a message in the end. negative, this is very disrespectful"

Hospital Sírio-Libanês | Bela Vista,"Rua Dona Adma Jafet, 115 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Guilherme Marques,"Rated 3.0 out of 5,",4 weeks ago,"The emergency room service is somewhat disorganized, causing silly mistakes, such as calling the wrong Guilherme and delaying my care.They asked me if I had any limiting illness and in the only possible time to do something wrong, they did so.They put access in my arm and they made a mistake, my arm turned purple, the nurse removed it and made a new one in another place, which also didn't look good, so the anesthetist had to redo it.During admission on the first day, they wrote down my pre and post surgery meal times, they forgot my breakfast and lunch before surgery, they called my doctor to ask for an alternative and as a result I stayed the whole day on two bottles. of whey. After surgery, my wife requested 21 hours and only arrived at 11:50 pm, after a lot of complaints.The doctor made a mark on my leg in the pre-surgery bath, they asked me to clean the part where the surgery would take place and with that I erased it. They didn't reschedule and didn't notify the doctor, who only found out at the time of the surgery that he was going to have to go back to the room to make the appointment again and get dressed again due to the staff's error, which didn't explain and didn't issue an alert as soon as the appointment came out. .They gave my doctor's contact information asking for information about another patient because his name was Guilherme (maybe the guy they answered wrong at the reception, we'll never know)If it were a municipal hospital or a neighborhood hospital, I think the rating would be 4 stars, but based on the hype that the name carries, I expected much more."

I was prevented from taking the exam because they didn't let my son enter the room. An absolute lack of empathy towards mothers!!! I booked the exam at Fleury, went with my son and received very good care.As my doctor had requested that I take the exam with a specific doctor in Sírio, I decided to give it a second chance. I scheduled the exam for 09/17/2024 at 2:00 pm. I had a professional appointment at 5pm, but I was calm, as the attendant at the appointment said the exam would last 20 minutes, so even if I was late, I would be able to leave by 4pm. I'm wrong!!!

The negligence and lack of will of the professionals at this hospital is absurd. A hospital waste and yet another reflection of what private complementary medicine has become in Brazil. This was not the worst of all my dissatisfactions. To illustrate the seriousness of the situation when I went to the professional to perform the exam, I noticed the doctor and Desídia's lack of preparation when providing care and preparing the report. This is because when issuing the report, after carrying out the exam, I noticed that very important information was missing, which I may have to redo in another laboratory. It is important to highlight that, this is a reference hospital in SP, it should not have structural flaws, lack of empathy with patients, poor service, among others.  NOTE ZEROOOOOO"

Now I've been dying in pain for over an hour and I haven't even been called to take medication, let alone take the tests requested by the doctor. In other words, 5 hours in the hospital, I still haven't been treated and I can't even predict how long it will take until the test results come out. When questioning the nursing team, I was informed that “there is no way of knowing” how many people are in front of me in line to take medication.

That's how it is at Hospital Sírio Libanês, and from the parking lot. I needed to go to the Emergency Room, but I entered the exam parking lot, everyone was very helpful and kind and took me to where I needed to go. So I say, that from parking, the treatment is different and without asking me if it was an agreement or private. And even though it was very busy, with many cases of dengue or flu, the treatment was very respectful and kind, and the medical team? All equally wonderful. From the attendants, the nurses and even the cleaning team, everyone gets a 10. Then you understand why it is considered one of the best in Brazil, Latin America and in the World rankings.

There was a SUS guide from the City of São Paulo with a request for 4 exams. The attendant Shemily refused to proceed with the exam request because the guide was stamped and signed by a nurse. COFEN itself reaffirms nurses' autonomy in prescribing tests and medications. These were important medication monitoring tests that I cannot do without and Sírio Libanês refused to do them due to lack of information. It is provided for in Health Ordinance No. 2,488/2011. Luckily, there was another guide from a doctor. If not, I would not have been able to take the exams."

I have been to several hospitals in recent years, when there is something negative we tend to complain and most of the time with good reason. But when the service is provided with excellence, it is also our obligation to praise. This is training, when all the employees, from reception to the doctor, treat you well, it is not by coincidence or compassion, each person has a genius, personal problems, bad days. I was very well looked after by everyone. The staff are polite, friendly, respectful, there is no delay, they did everything to make me as comfortable as possible, they even asked me if I would like to listen to music on my phone during the MRI exam, I had never seen that before. The work is excellent and agile. This is excellence in service provision. Rating 10 for Hospital Sírio Libanês, Bela Vista Unit. I have never been treated so well in a hospital as I am today at Sírio. Congratulations to the entire team there."

My health plan does not cover tests, so I always research carefully between laboratories. This time I ended up at Sírio Libanês to have a colonoscopy. The budget was given to me in full detail with the total at 2114 reais. Among the items, as shown in the attached photo, two refer to medical fees - anesthetist. Everything was fine, I arrived at Sírio, paid the indicated amount, took the exam. Today I received a WhatsApp from an anesthesiologist company charging me 440 reais for the anesthetist's fee. Hey? He said that on the second page, clause c of item 4 (obviously in smaller letters) it says that it may not include the anesthetist. Hey? So what do the two anesthetist medical fee items in the budget refer to? I questioned all of this with the company and they said everything was fine because they issued a note so I could get a refund… 😵 look at the healthcare mafia in Brazil. So I'm going to pay twice because I'm going to get a refund? Hello PROCON, can this? Now tell me… why at no point did the hospital inform me that the anesthesiologist was not paid? And at the same time indicated it twice in the budget? Can I by any chance take the exam without anesthesia? Or can I bring my personal anesthetist? - AFTER 3 WEEKS AND CONSULTATION WITH PROCON SUPPORTING MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTS, THE CASE WAS CLOSED AND THEY STOPPED CHARGING ME."

Hospital Sírio-Libanês | Bela Vista,"Rua Dona Adma Jafet, 115 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Jaqueline F.,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"My first hospitalization and I confess that I was unhappy at some points. Some professionals with ill will tarnish the image of the hospital and the good professionals that also exist.Customer service people need to listen and help, instead of saying no, without checking, and even with hostility.Hybrid nursing team in quality, some nurses are super attentive, others don't even introduce themselves or just introduce themselves.  Some technicians were attentive and careful, others were rushed and even hostile. Some don't even keep the correct medication times or leave the injectable medication for hours and when I woke up, I had to call to collect it and close it...Some professionals on the 15th floor and in hospitality deserve to be congratulated, I won't remember everyone's names, but I'll highlight a few:- Alice (hospitality), polite, kind and can make things flow.- Erika (Nurse Tech), excellent professional and would make a great nurse. Super careful and kind.- Physiotherapist (Mestizo-Oriental), I don't remember her name, but it's worth highlighting her qualities, she's super attentive and goes above and beyond her activities.  She helped me with some difficulties that were beyond her duties.It is important to note that there is a need for greater alignment and training of employees, and that in fragile moments of hospitalization, especially when there is no companion, employees are at least attentive and polite."

Leaves at 5pm. The main doctor simply didn't show up to give a diagnosis. I don't think I was even in the room for the procedure. I was left in the hands of newly trained doctors. Absurd. In an exam that takes place every 3 years. In a patient with a history of diverticula, he is 63 years old, and the doctor does not show up. Apart from the 50 minutes they left me waiting to go in for the procedure (they were probably going to have lunch). Colonoscopy and endoscopy never again. At Fleury, the same exam was carried out 2 years ago. I went in at 7:00 and by 13:00 I was already having lunch in a restaurant. It's a shame because the structure is great. But the coordination of colonoscopy definitely needs to be changed. I'm not coming back. Neither does my wife. And we don't recommend it to anyone"

I looked for this hospital because they told me it was a reference for breast cancer treatment. 2 months after the surgery I had to be hospitalized because in addition to not healing as it should, the skin started to necrote. I had to be admitted to the Santa Casa de Misericórdia in Maceió, where I was, because I had a fever and it was discovered that I contracted a hospital infection in Sirio. I was hospitalized for 1 month, including 3 weeks of very strong antibiotics and two more surgical procedures to clean all necrosis from my breast.It's funny that while I was hospitalized, Sírio sent me emails threatening to put me in the SPC because I had to pay for part of an MRI scan that I had before the surgery, but it was paid with a discount that I requested before the exam. I think the luck of these people is that Brazilians don't have the habit of suing for everything like Americans do.I do not recommend this hospital at all. In addition to the administration being terrible, the doctors, nurses and nursing technicians I came into contact with left a lot to be desired in terms of competence."

My difficulty as a patient companion was eating. I am gluten and lactose intolerant and allergic to some fruits. Upon admission, they asked the patient about dietary restrictions, but did not mention anything about food for companions. So, I tried to have lunch at one of the restaurants that operate on site, but there were almost no dish options within my restrictions. Only at night did I find out that they offer meals for companions, thanks to the person who brought the inpatient's meal and saw me in the room. However, I was not asked anything about restrictions. The next morning, breakfast only had things I couldn't eat. I spoke to the pantry, but they said I would have to wait for the nutritionist to come by, which happened hours later. I gave up and went out to look. I managed to resolve it at Cafeteria Dulca, (for me the best establishment within the hospital). Only around lunch time did the nutritionist come. She was very attentive, and even though I was not patient, she understood my difficulty and sent a meal within my lunch restrictions. I think it would be nice for the hospital to incorporate this procedure, due to the difficulty for companions to move around. And I don't think this care is just about the meals they offer, but also about bringing restaurants to the hospital that have options for different types of diet."

After the evaluation with the doctor, he prescribed a sequence of 4 aerolin puffs with an interval of 20 minutes each and 10 ml of predsim So far everything is ok as I am used to doing this procedure at home. Then nurse Juliana arrives with the medication....and how...I'm used to this sequence of puffs that would be 1 puff counts up to 10...another puff counts up to 10, thus totaling 4 puffs.The nurse placed the spacer with aerolin and applied 10 puffs each count, she pressed the pump...I asked about the procedure as I had never seen that before, she told me that it was like that...I found that strange and immediately sent a message to the my husband tells me what happened. After 20 minutes another professional came to apply the puffs and she told me mom there are 4 puffs with a count of 10...so I asked...is there any technique that applies 10 puffs she said NO...we applied 1 puff and we count to 10...at that time I asked to speak to the superior on duty, it is unacceptable for a pediatric nurse to make such a serious mistake, taking care of a child requires a lot of attention and concentration...a medication error can cost the life.I immediately called superior LUIZ and told him what had happened, I also talked to the professional who was nothing like a professional because I told him that I had done the correct procedure...I called this woman and asked if she had the courage to look me in the eyes and say that she hadn't done it...she told me...Madam, I'm not going to argue with you...With the badge turned upside down I asked her name and she said Juliana.Well, I'll ask for the camera images...I called the Dr to re-evaluate my son and leave, I was so angry.Completely out of control nurse, as soon as I sat in the box waiting to be called for the appointment, she commented to the other colleague, today I'm angry and hungry.I admire a hospital of this size having incompetent professionals on its team..Outraged.Care could cost a child their life."

I arrived at the hospital at 6:25 pm in the flu symptoms ward and the screening was very quick, worthy of praise. Upon arriving on the eighth floor, there was just a lack of care. I was in a lot of pain and the receptionists were talking about travel instead of opening my file. I was outraged by the lack of sensitivity even though I saw the patient in pain. Without any satisfaction, I waited almost an hour to sign the agreement paper. They left me in a room to be seen and the nurses I asked for help (two young men, one skinny and the other gray-haired) simply said they would look and never came back. I complained to Anelise who came to ask me questions that should have already been asked and told me that she was a concierge. I told her everything that was happening and she asked me to continue waiting. After another 20 minutes I went to talk to her again and she told me that her part had already been done and that it was now up to the floor nurse. I went to talk to nurse Rebeca and she replied saying that I had been admitted to the floor at 7:32 pm, when it had been over an hour, the issue is that they didn't open the service. In short, terrible service from a hospital that has a name. What disappointed me most was the negligence and lack of satisfaction for the patient, who is left waiting for their wishes. I was in room 814 and next to me was a lady called Marlene also complaining about the delay. Total lack of preparation and if the leader Rebeca cares little about the patient, who will say the subordinates. Let's see if there will be a return to the complaints I see here."

Completely disorganized, does care at all about their patients. I was begging them for help in resolving a billing issue and every department just ignored me. Do not go to this hospital.I went to this hospital to get an outpatient procedure done which required that I have an attendant with me. The hospital organized for an attendant to be provided, at a fee, from an outside company. On the day of the procedure I was brought to the billing department by  member of their ""concierge"" team, Fernanda. They have an international ""concierge"" service which basically provides translators so that you can navigate the hospital if your Portugues is not great. At the billing office I was presented with a bill for the cost of the procedure. I agreed to pay it and was then given a credit card machine to make the payment. When the machine arrived, the amount they were requesting was higher than the quoted amount. When I asked Fernanda, she explained that the additional amount was for the cost of the attendant. I paid the invoice and was only provided with a little slip of paper that showed the amount that I had paid. It didn't say what services I had paid for, just that I had paid a certain amount. I then went and got the procedure done. I was put-under, so I don't know how the actual medical procedure went, but from what I saw before I went under, the medical professionals seemed like they were doing a good job. After the procedure was finished, I was brought to the payment office and presented with a new bill. The bill included the additional cost of part of the procedure, the cost to have a biopsy analyzed and the cost of the attendant (which I already paid for). For the next 3 weeks I was going back and forth with the International department, the complaints department and the billing department, trying to get them to acknowledge the fact that I had already paid for the attendant. No one from any of those departments did a single thing to try to help me. Each department passed me off to another department. The complaints department didn't even reply to my complaint. I had to call them up weeks after I had filed a complaint and they were fully aware of the situation, but didn't have enough respect to let me know that they were working on my case or bother to email or call me to help get it resolved. Neither did the International department. When I asked them to help me resolve the issue they just said ""this is not my department, I don't know anything about billing"" even though FERNANDA was there and was the one that explained to me that I was paying for the the price of the attendant. The billing department just kept sending me the same invoice over and over again and never acknowledging that I had paid for the attendant. It was only when I finally decided to go to the hospital and pay the bill that anything got done. I had to physically go to the International department and demand that they resolve the issue that instant. I spent another 2 hours going to different departments with the ""concierge"" lady, getting into arguments and explaining  over and over what had happened. It was only then, that they acknowledged that the woman who processed my payment allocated the entire amount to the cost of the procedure, which was why this bill for the attendant was still outstanding. At my insistence  they finally removed the charge and I was able to pay the invoice. If you go to a Brazilain Hospital, make sure that you get an itemized invoice for every single payment that you make. A little slip of paper with the amount on it is not enough. They will change the amount that you owe them and you have no proof of what you have already paid for. At the end of the day, I probably wasted about 4-5 hours of my time writing emails, sending messages on Whatsapp and arguing with the staff at the hospital. Not to mention all of the frustration it caused. This could have been resolved after 1 email, had anyone at the hospital taken ownership of the problem and been accountable. DO NOT GO HERE - THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS"

The PS reception is a complete mess, unprepared attendant, 1 nurse in triage who has the ability to identify an emergency, complete chaos and neglect. As even though I arrived in a very bad condition they didn't attend to me, I had to go in alone and shout in the corridor to be attended to (remembering that it was in the most expensive hospital in the country, and not in the public health system, okay?!)After that they decided to treat me and did an electrocardiogram, where they identified that I had prolonged QT, this is very serious, anyone with a minimum of common sense just needs to Google it to find out. They left me under observation monitoring my heartbeat, they didn't inform me that I was 600 qt prolonged (which is a very significant number), and they didn't even give me any consistent information about my case. Suddenly they put me in the ICU, also without telling me why, and the battery of tests began. From then on there was another series of absurdities and lack of organization, which I will also report below.I have complained of pressure in my head since theThe moment I entered, however, they remained in the heart exams and requested a heart resonance withIn contrast, I had this MRI and after 1 day I still had a lot of pressure on my head and after a lot of complaints on my part they decided that I would have to do an MRI on my head as well (which obviously they could have already done along with the heart), they took me down to the exam, and after 30 minutes in the chair waiting, the technician came with the questionnaire and I asked if I could take contrast again as I had done it 1 day ago, she was surprised and said that she couldn't give contrast again due to the risk of overload my kidney! Detail, no doctor or nurse at the hospital noticed this, they were going to give me contrast 2x in less than 48 hours due to a total lack of organization and internal communication.This is the macro of the bizarre things I went through during these 4 days in hospital, but there are several others, such as 10 of my veins being removed in 2 days, not communicating with me with respect and transparency about my clinical condition, among other minor things.It is, to say the least, revolting to pay so much for a HEALTH service, and to be treated with so much neglect and neglect.If the so-called best hospital in this country is like this, imagine the worst. That's why so many people die before their time, so many cases could be avoided and are not. Shame is the name we have to give to the health service in Brazil.Totally unprepared nursing technicians, emergency reception that seems like a joke, doctors who don't communicate, that's what we have in sírio, einstein and so many other hospitals.

You ""dispatch"" the body in the coffin in the open air. Furthermore, the same concierge that does this is the same one that receives the poor motorcycle couriers who watch this scene. A hospital of Sirio Libanes' standard does not have a reserved, covered and respectful space to do this. If you need, I have photos of what happened.~They treat the patient very well while they are alive and they do this after they are dead. It's ugly.

The procedure she will undergo requires her to fast for many hours. It also requires the presence of a companion. I really enjoy doing exams and consultations here. The problem is when it's time to make breakfast, or when the companion (Me) who is 7 hours away at the hospital decides to eat. Because we are vegans, we do not eat milk, eggs, cheese, processed foods or any other food of animal origin. And the Sírio Libanês hospital does not seem to have the slightest preparation to deal with this situation. I've already made countless suggestions, even some time ago.  But they continue to insist on disrespecting people’s nutritional freedom. Until when? We are already in the 21st century, you need to update yourself!! This region is home to the largest number of vegans in Latin America. Veganism grows 2000% per year in Brazil. I am available to provide voluntary consultancy to compose a vegan menu."

My opinion is that unfortunately they are more concerned with fame and luxury and have forgotten the most important thing: the humanized service they defend!The waiting time for a bed in the ICU, availability of room spaces and care from nurses was declining. (It's one game at the other, all with different excuses and information) Not counting the bureaucratic part with the paperwork, there is a lack of communication between the nursing team and doctors. Thank God EVERYTHING worked and we didn't have any emergencies, I wonder what is worth so much fame, luxury, better plans and better doctors, if everything is very time consuming and confusing. WE STILL FIGHT for LIVES in this excellent, renowned hospital!!Disappointed."

The waiting time for service is at least 10 times shorter than reported on the website and also through the APP. The lack of employees is evident! Nurses try to work miracles to serve hospital consumers. Doctors, there are always a reduced number and less and less experienced. Unfortunately, the services are no longer the same. They are only concerned with luxury: marble, beautiful boulevards, reception and forgetting the essential thing: the humanized service that they have always defended. A great shame....Below are photos of the time I arrived at the hospital, the appointment to open the form: 1 hour and 30 minutes of waiting and no service. Meanwhile, on the website and app and also at the hospital reception they inform that there is no waiting for orthopedic care."
