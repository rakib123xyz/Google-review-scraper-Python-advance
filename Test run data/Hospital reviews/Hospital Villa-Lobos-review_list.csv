Furthermore, the doctor's schedule was to see a patient every 20 minutes, but her consultations do not take less than 1 hour with each person, in other words, one disrespect on top of another.

Then I went to the allergo, she asked for a milk allergy test and immunoglobulin E, then the milk test was negative and the immunoglobulin was high, she said it was bad skin elasticity, and my problem is ALLERGIC. Lazy doctor was TOO LAZY to order more tests to investigate. I'm going to look for opinions outside this hospital because they're all lazy, the gastro didn't even want to help me properly, he was nervous because he said the girls at the reception doubled his schedule, and then he was super rude to me and pushed the problem to the hospital, who pushed it back to he. I don't recommend it to anyone, terrible service, I'm going to do the tests that the gastro doctor politely asked for BECAUSE I INSISTED and I'm going to take the results to a decent doctor."

As soon as we arrived we waited to go up to the room, when we arrived in the room my husband made all the preparations for the exam, at 2:00 pm I asked the nurse what time he would go up, and she told me that he would go up in 30 minutes. At 4:16 pm my husband was taken for the exam and I remained in the room, the nurse said he would return in 30 minutes. At 6:20 pm Adriano came down, that is, I spent the day at the hospital as an escort, they didn't even take a glass of water to the room, remembering that water is not denied to anyone. I fasted with my husband because I couldn't go down and leave him alone, and after he went for the exam I couldn't either, he would come back quickly. I was only informed that the companion's food would be charged at 7:00 pm when my husband's food would arrive. I already had a headache, my husband did too, I had to struggle to get food and water to arrive. Not even the SUS treats patients like this. Neglect and lack of respect, I even found out from the nurse that my husband was already discharged at 4:00 pm, even though he hadn't even had the exam yet. A horror show.

The Hospital reception initially seemed confused when it came to clarifying doubts, directing the matter to other more experienced attendants. Well, because it was a Private Surgical Procedure (Approx. R$64 thousand reais including the Medical Team) the Nursing Manager was unable to explain or even there was a process (procedure) for transferring the ICU (if necessary) to Hospital 09 July for example (coverage under my insurance plan). In this aspect, it generated an intense and heated discussion among the employees of this establishment (the UTi daily rate in the private sector can reach $40 thousand per day, and I already have an insurance plan) and later with my wife, who was quite nervous, by the way, before to go to the Surgical Center. After 10 hours of Surgery, I returned to the Ok Apartment. Meal requests were different at all times and deliveries took a long time. You order one type of soup, they give you another. They say that a companion is entitled to the meals, then another person who delivers the meal said no. A type of soup was requested 3 times, they delivered the wrong flavor of soup and one of these times they said it was for the companion (look at the discrepancy in information). The room and bathroom were requested to be cleaned several times, but were completely ignored until the date of leaving the hospital. The Physiotherapist was asked to help with mobility after the patient's 10-hour surgery, there was a heated discussion between Nurse Luciana (who was trying to help us) and the Physiotherapist who did not want to assist, refused, as according to her it was not on her agenda . As the wife had 02 Drains (Pelvic in front and Coquis in the back), the Nursing Leader performed assistance and when trying to adjust the Connectors to remove the Liquids, which ended up leaving them poorly fitted and ending up dirtying the entire bed with blood and grease on the Body Strap. that we purchased privately. Unfortunately, it was a TOTAL DISORDER, with the exception of the Nursing Technicians Lucas, Cris and Nurse Luciana who were always very helpful and trying to help at all times (they have no autonomy, no matter how hard they tried). Furthermore, for anyone who intends to undergo Plastic Surgery or any type of Surgery in this Hospital, RUN AWAY, I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!!!Note01: We live in the interior of SP Capital, we traveled 2 hours and 30 minutes by car (5 hours round trip) to go through all this trouble at the Hospital.Note02: The Medical team (private) did a great job with the Surgical procedure we contracted, including: - Silicone Prosthesis - Face - Double chin - Liposculpture and Abdominoplasty. Post-surgical treatment by the Medical team is being carried out in the Office of the responsible Doctor on Av. Paulista."

The second time I was already paying attention and before signing, I observed and saw that something was still wrong and I communicated with the attendant and she fixed the errors. Another thing that I didn't agree with is that the hospital does not provide food for the companion. If the companion is unable to do so, he or she will become hungry. But contrary to these denials, the hospital is very clean, the food is very good, the room is organized and the staff welcomed me with great politeness and cordiality."

My first problem started at reception, which took virtually 1 hour to open my file - the file was actually opened at around 11:00 pm.After opening the form and going through the screening process, in which I was treated very well, I went to the office to be seen by the first doctor. I told the doctor in question about the problem I was experiencing, and she showed no interest during the treatment - I would even say a certain irritability. I told the doctor that I had a case of sinusitis at the beginning of the month and, in the same Vila Lobos emergency room, I was seen and treated correctly (antibiotics and other medications): even after the treatment, some symptoms did not disappear and, in As a result, I sought out the service in question.The doctor didn't even get up from her chair to examine my nose, face and throat, listen to my lungs with a stethoscope or show any interest in what I said: on the contrary, as soon as I mentioned my problem, she already made diagnoses using technical terms that, for a person who Looking for an emergency room with a headache and other symptoms, it was extremely scary. When talking about the headache she was feeling to the doctor, she used technical terms to ask the exact location of the pain: medicine needs to be more humanized, as does language, especially in emergency care. Furthermore, he repeatedly said to look for an ENT, showing that he had no interest in better understanding what was happening to me. After the quick - really - interaction with the doctor, she gave me medications to be consumed in the unit itself, blood tests and a CT scan.Regarding the medications I took intravenously, as well as the blood test, I PRAISE the nursing staff, who were kind, cordial and patient during all the procedures. They were the only employees who treated me with empathy and respect.After finishing the medications (around 1:20 am on the morning of March 28), I went to the tomography department, where I was promptly attended to. The other problem happened next: the tomography result/report came out after TWO AND A HALF HOURS of waiting: I asked reception at various times for some opinion, some prediction, and the answers were always evasive and short, as if they hadn't no interest in helping. After my wife went directly to the tomography room, at almost 4:00 am on 03/28, the responsible department said that they had already released the results a long time ago, blaming the reception department for what happened (who can I believe?).After all this, the doctor who provided the initial care left (probably her shift was over) and, unfortunately, I managed to receive even worse care from the second doctor: she was clearly willing to dismiss me from her office as quickly as possible, which was barely commented on. exam results. He said that I no longer had a bacterial sinus infection, according to the blood test and, according to the results of the tomography, he simply told me to see an ENT. I asked what I could do to alleviate the symptoms I was experiencing (a lot, a lot of thick secretion that was constantly coughing up through the nose, which, I believe, was causing the headache I was feeling, as I was straining a lot to try to expectorate it) , and she prescribed simply washing the nose with saline solution and using budesonide (she didn't even print a prescription). Regarding the results of the tomography, I said that I was scared, since it said that I had a deviated septum, since I had the operation in the middle of last year - I asked her if there was a possibility that the deviated septum had returned so quickly and she replied, in a mocking tone ""How should I know, I didn't perform your surgery"". This entire intervention lasted no more than two minutes, making the ill will of the professional in question clear."

I arrived at 5am as directed, only to discover that there was no bed available to accommodate me.Furthermore, I was informed that my health insurance plan would be charged a daily rate, even though I had not been accommodated in a suitable bed. I was forced to wait at reception until moments before carrying out the procedure, which demonstrates a total lack of consideration and empathy for the patient.This experience made it clear that the hospital lacks the organization and capacity to deal with the basic needs of patients. Not only that, but the care provided was extremely precarious, not in line with the minimum standards expected in a healthcare institution.I honestly cannot recommend this hospital to anyone, and I hope steps are taken to improve reception and patient care in the future."

Today, for example, I'm at reception with about 60 people, and there's only one employee to serve everyone. If this poor thing wants to go to the bathroom, it will make the situation even worse here, regrettable. Then they complain that the receptionists are not friendly, but the multimillionaire hospital administrators have no mercy in overloading the attendants. Summary, we arrived 20 minutes before the appointment, we've been waiting for 30 minutes and we haven't even gone to the counter, there are still about 6/7 people in front and the girl at reception isn't to blame, she's not inefficient. It's the network's fault for wanting to pay one person to do the work, which would involve at least 3 people, just for pure money."

There was an incident at the hospital and there was simply one nurse left to care for all the patients in the emergency room. This is unbelievable, how can a hospital leave the emergency room with 1 nurse. Terrible management, which does not hire employees, does not relocate from other floors. Bad, bad and bad, we went home without medication. I've been to a public hospital and I've never seen just 1 nurse in the emergency room. I will never go to that hospital again. I don't even complain about the nurse, he was a survivor in that place. Everyone who is sick wants to be treated and only him. This is a hospital MANAGEMENT problem. Doctors shouldn't even prescribe intravenous medication if they don't have employees. It would have been better to send someone to another hospital. Anyway, the MANAGEMENT of the hospital is terrible. Even the head nurse wasn't there, it was just the technician. If someone had a cardiorespiratory arrest, I think those who would help would be the companions. I have never seen such bad management from a private hospital."

I STAYED OVER THE MEDICATION FOR AT LEAST 40 MINUTES AND IN THAT TIME THERE WAS NO CHANGE OF GLOVES AT ANY TIME, MUCH LESS THE USE OF ALCOHOL GEL.

It was a return visit and there were changes to the exams requested. When I got there, they sent me to the wrong floor. When I was called to register, they informed me that it was on the 8th floor, right before the appointment time. My luck is that there are people who work with love for patients and an attendant, surnamed Honório, on that floor, kindly offered to take us inside the hospital, so that we wouldn't miss our appointment.  Arriving on the 8th floor, it was a desert, there was no one.  Miss Honório discovered that the doctor had canceled all afternoon appointments. I understand that the doctor has problems, because we are all human, now, not being warned and leaving far away with an 82-year-old lady, in an UBER, in traffic, and missing the trip because no one from the hospital warned us is a huge disrespect.  Being sent to the wrong floor, too! Now Miss. surnamed Honório, deserves all my praise and thanks. Seeing my concern about a bacteria found in my mother's urine test, he spared no effort and got us an appointment with a General Practitioner, who saw us about an hour later. All my complaints to an administration that fails to notify patients about canceled appointments, all my appreciation to Ms. Honorio who does his work with love and dedication.  A huge compliment to this employee! People like this the world needs! (I forgot her first name, but her last name is Honório!) My eternal gratitude to this being of light!!!!"

I was discharged yesterday from Villa Lobos Hospital. I was admitted to the ICU for 3 days with a diagnosis of tracheobronchitis. To begin with, I want to praise the hospital for its very good and comfortable infrastructure. The service at the PS was also very good. I felt welcomed in the ICU too, however, there was specifically one issue that bothered me and I wouldn't want other people to go through the same situation. Even though I have always warned, and for all time, that my veins are difficult to access because they are very deep and thin, that they burst and do not hold a catheter, the laboratory had to pierce me more than once, causing pain and bruising. But so far so good. The biggest problem occurred later, when the antibiotic Klaricid was administered intravenously, so that for 03 hours, the medicine ripped my vein from the inside, and made me feel immense pain. I really suffered a lot. I even believe that I must be hypersensitive to the medicine. However, this situation was not handled well by the ICU nursing team. A first mistake was not knowing that the aforementioned antibiotic already has a reputation for being quite painful and knowing my difficulty with the vein, they could have at least checked with the doctor on duty whether it could have been administered orally. A second mistake was ignoring my warnings about the difficulties in locating the veins and even so calling another technique to try again to pierce my other arm, twice, without success. The third mistake was that, even after having finished administering the medication into the vein, I was surprised by another nurse while I was sleeping to pierce close to my access in order to find another vein for the next injection of the medication. That's when I almost woke up scared and clarified that the problem wasn't with my access and I didn't want to lose it. Finally, the next day, with the glory of God, I was informed that the medication would be administered orally. I sincerely regret that I had to go through all this and I ask that the hospital better guide its employees regarding the specificity of this medication, and not ignore the patient's information and pain. Other than that, everything was great. Thanks."

The call dropped when I spoke to the answering machine, and when someone answered and I informed them that the call was dropped, sometimes they transferred me without me even finishing my sentence, and then it dropped again. After a lot of trying, I succeeded, but only through a transfer from an attendant.The facilities are very ugly, the hospital looks old and old, but it has been well made up by the network to look elegant.I wouldn't recommend it."

In the specialties I underwent (clinical and gastro) there was a delay of up to 1 and a half hours, but despite this, the service from all the doctors was excellent! They do not respond in a hurry, they take the patient's anamnesis and examine them. I once went to the gynecologist with tests ready just for evaluation and even so, she did a gynecological exam during the consultation, which I thought was very good due to her concern (Dr.Barbara). With the clinician (Dr.Bruno) very helpful, I requested, listened to my complaints, examined me and carried out a series of UP check exams. The gastroenterologist (Dr. Thamie) attended without rushing, asked a lot of questions, and was extremely careful.Don't rush to be seen because they take a while but they serve you very well. That's my opinion! Rating 10 for the team!"

I was admitted to the PS, Saturday at 11 pm, with dehydration due to severe diarrhea and vomiting. The doctor who attended to me sent me to the outpatient clinic where I took a drip with medication, which was good for me because I arrived very dehydrated and with low blood pressure. During the re-evaluation, which took place at almost 1 am, he asked me for a blood count and said the results would come out in 20 minutes, he was lying, it took 1:30 am, the test was already approved for the doctor, but he took another 40 minutes to give me answer because my husband went to complain. My blood count was ok, but even so, due to my blood pressure, he thought it would be better for me to stay for monitoring in the ICU on the 5th floor. I went up to the ICU at around 4:30 am. My plan was for an apartment and I was placed in an ICU with another 15 beds. Regarding the care provided by the nurses and nursing technicians, I was well attended to, but I have some complaints, the diet, besides being terrible, was not suitable for my condition, they had two bathrooms. for purging and two for baths with shower, but they were used by men and women, this is unacceptable, at least they should separate one for men and one for women. During my hospitalization, I didn't even receive a hygiene kit and the bathroom lacked soap to even wash my hands, there was only alcohol gel. The professionals were very attentive but I thought they talked too loudly as if they were at home, including the doctor in charge, a lack of respect for the patient. Not to mention that the PS doctor said I would stay between 12 and 24 hours, another big lie, even though 12 hours later I was fine, they held me until the next day so I could be discharged, I actually was discharged from the ICU at 10:00: 30 am on Monday, when the doctor came by, then I waited for space for me to go to the room and there I would only be discharged home on Tuesday after 10 am, when the doctor would come by again. After 8 hours of waiting for a room, very irritated I called the head nurse to ask her to sign a waiver of further care, which was not necessary, and left. It was unnecessary to spend 39 hours in a hospital if I was already great in the first 12 hours. As for me having a plan that gave me the right to a room with monitoring and it wasn't offered to me because maybe they didn't have one, they should have informed me, which they didn't. Big mistake that won't happen again with me, because I will never do it again."

Finally, a possible Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed, we are still waiting for the results of some tests.I would like to thank all the doctors who attended to me, in addition to Dr Bruno, who in a clinical consultation managed to feel that there was something different even when there was no interference during auscultation, Dr Luis, who even though he was a PS doctor and needed to give me such delicate news was human, respectful, attentive and careful, the hematologist Dr Wellington, who was also super careful and delicate when speaking to me after hospitalization and the MRI report, the nursing team and technicians/assistants, especially Helena who all the days who accompanied me was so cute and gave me the pleasure of knowing her story, which is beautiful by the way, the nurse Grete who accompanied me on the first night, which is always the most difficult and scary, Drs Barbara and Dayana who performed the procedure of my biopsy, who saw me so nervous but they were so human, to nurse Marcos, who knows that everyone who arrives there to do exams is super tense and tries to bring joy and lightness to us, the girls who help with cleaning, the nutritionists and other people in the cup, anyway, I want to thank all of you very much, in addition to thanking God, for having placed so many wonderful and human people in my path.Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all of you, without a doubt this affection and care is what makes the difference in our hospital stays, which are often unexpected and frightening.Congratulations to the entire team and once again I am immensely grateful to Dr Bruno Topis for all his care for me and my family.May God bless each one of you and your families"

Training, equipment, etc, etc, etc. I've had several problems with Villa Lobos in the last 2 years, but we ALL need to know how to recognize and also know how to praise when what was already pointed out by you simply changes!This time, upon arrival, in the middle of Hallelujah Saturday (a holiday where we already expect the unwillingness of some employees to be working while they could be at home with their families) the security guard was concerned about generating a password; the cordiality of the attendant who was opening the patients' files; the friendliness of the nursing team at the PS at 5pm on a Saturday; the doctors and even my hospitalization was spectacular.- The room was very clean (in better condition than the last one I had stayed in);- the surgical center (I used it 45 days ago too) with brand new equipment (I'm in the healthcare field, I've been working with medical and imaging equipment for 30 years);- the hospital food (my diet was bland) was delicious. Guys, praising hospital food these days is RARITY!- the concern of nursing technicians Vitor, Lucas, Jaque, etc... nurse VERA, including Dr Caio, who even questioned him about the management of my case, because of my pain, they treated me with the utmost cordiality, affection and demonstrated readiness to resolve the problem.Anyway, when it comes to criticizing, most people know how to do it. But most people don't send compliments because they think it's a waste of time to write.The truth has to be told and we have to recognize that changes have happened and as a resident of Mooca, I feel flattered to have a great location 2 blocks from my apartment.Thank you to the entire team at Villa Lobos Hospital for the welcome and the new restructuring!Congratulations on the change!"

On return we were 15 minutes late, they considered not answering because of the DELAY, and the result? We waited 55 minutes to be served. Great structure, very bad service"
