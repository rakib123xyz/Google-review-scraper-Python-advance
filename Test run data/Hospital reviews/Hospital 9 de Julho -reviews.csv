I'm in the ICU now. I didn't eat here for 28 hours yesterday, because the speech area didn't receive notice at 10am that I would be allowed to go on a diet, even though I questioned it from time to time. It came to the room at 4pm, after I removed all access and declared my discharge. The professional neuro doctor came to give me my side in a 'mocking way', as if questioning my narrative, as if I were inventing the symptoms that brought me here by ambulance from my home. The areas don't talk to each other properly. I'm horrified, wishing I was far away from here as soon as possible. Positive points: all the technicians who accompanied me, nurse Letícia, the doctor from the PS who was impeccable, accompanying me the entire time during the stroke protocol."

All my doctors are from there and I've had 3 surgeries, all of which were completely successful. I have always been treated VERY well, whether by reception, nurses or doctors.  Is it a perfect institution? Of course.  Perfection exists only in our minds, but it is certainly one of the best medical institutions we can trust with our health.  Disclaimer: I have no friendships or interests in this statement, it is just a way of repaying everything the hospital has done for me."

My sincere thanks to Dr Gustavo Lamas, Pain Neurologist... excellent doctor who takes great care of my mother Etelvina Baptista.Attt Cleide Baptista"

He read a test and said I was lactose intolerant.  When I looked for the specialist, it wasn't true. Since then I have stopped trusting this service you offer. However, for 15 days I have been receiving daily calls, more than one call per day, where I clearly tell all the attendants that I do not want the service and ask them to remove my phone number from that customer list. In vain. The next day I receive more calls.I started politely but I lost my patience.In the last few days there were: 2 calls on 24.09, at 11:20 and 15:57 hrs, 1 call on 30.09 at 10:39 hrs, 1 call on Saturday 05.10 at 13:06 hrs, 5 calls on 07.10, at 09:00: 52, 13:02, 16:03 and the 18:55 hrs, 1 call on 08.10 at 15:10 hrs, 1 call on 09.10 at 18:27, 1 call on 10.10 at 15:02 hrs.Hell.

He was admitted to the emergency room, went to the infirmary where he spent approximately 3 hours without medication and was monitored by a blood pressure monitor. He underwent tests such as an electrocardiogram. While we waited for the results to come out, I spoke to the doctor who was the second doctor and said that he was feeling very ill within 5 days. She said she was checking what measures she was going to take, asked to see tests done previously, and said she had a change in her heart. She asked about the family history, and said that she was thinking about hospitalization, I was quite worried leaving there, but once without a diagnosis it would be very worrying, I was frank with her, we were looking for somewhere that has hospitalization, because anything that happens to him It is the lady's responsibility. She was scared and said she would evaluate the possibility of hospitalization. 40 minutes later he called me and said he had been admitted and would be removed, I ran out of the hospital and went to get some clothes for him, when I arrived the other doctor on duty discharged him who was pale and still complaining of pain.... In the meantime that I was in the unit, I saw two patients who were discharged, one fainting after getting up on the stretcher and the other leaning on the ward door to avoid falling.We left there and took him to another unit, which provided adequate care, in addition to redoing the tests, which were inconclusive. The hospital has the structure to be great, but it leaves something to be desired."

He spent the whole day doing exams with an absurd delay despite it not being that crowded. Several people passed in front despite her having super priority due to her age of 85 years. When the tests didn't show anything, they sent her home without even giving her a sling despite her having told her that she had pain in her arm. We thought about buying one at the pharmacy but they don't have it here. Now she's wearing a scarf tied up because not even the decency of giving this elderly woman a miserable sling to support her arm was enough and she came holding her arm in the car.Is this the care that a hospital of this name provides?

The service was quick and the explanations about the treatment were clear and detailed, which brought security to our family at such a delicate time. The hospital has a modern and well-equipped structure, which contributed to a more comfortable and welcoming environment. The nurses and other healthcare professionals were attentive and always available to answer questions and offer support. Thanks to the quality of care, my aunt recovered well and had an effective post-operative period. The overall experience was very positive, and we were satisfied with the treatment we received. Rating:5/5. I recommend Hospital Nove de Julho to anyone looking for excellent care."
Hospital Nove de Julho,"Rua Peixoto Gomide, 645 - Cerqueira César, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Magda Duarte Alves,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",4 months ago,"Neglect in the care of the PS doctor Mrs. Carolina Reis Bonízio - CRM 200.709, which made me feel terrible - dismissed the complaint for which I took my son to the PS. The Hospital mentions that it is the patient's right ""to have dignified, attentive and respectful care, without prejudice to race, creed, color, age, sex or diagnosis"". I had to ask the doctor to listen to my son's lungs, as she only said that he was fine and nothing was out of health. I asked her to do an X-ray of my son's lungs and when she returned, this doctor gave us a ""highchair"" for another hour, just calling new patients and not giving us a return on the X-ray. Conclusion: After almost 3 hours of waiting, I had to leave the hospital without hearing back from the doctor, the X-ray or if my son had any problems.  I suggest that the hospital have better criteria for hiring doctors, as it is not enough to be well trained, you have to have the humanity to consider patients' complaints and respect the waiting time before and after requesting an exam. A mother doesn't leave the house, she takes traffic to GO TO THE HOSPITAL!!!"

Doctor Vinícius is a gypsy type of doctor, one who has a crystal ball and assesses your pain by intuition. I think the gypsy thought I wanted surgery or something like that, people for the love of God, I just wanted something that would make my shoulder stop hurting. The gypsy requested an infiltration in my shoulder, he barely looked at my MRI, he didn't prescribe any anti-inflammatory, I felt like a liar, embarrassed. Unfortunately, I didn't like the service, it's not humanized, believe me, there are much better hospitals with professionals and not gypsies."

Wonderful medical team (from outside the hospital), excellent assistants, attentive post-operative care, leaves for the room at 11pm.It started there, the food arrived late, because my companion requested: observation: if I am in surgery and return to the room, this should be protocol (I believe). 12 hours fasting. And speaking of the companion (there is an armchair just to accommodate him, so he didn't sleep here, he has a back problem, how could he sleep in the chair? The tiny room, without a sofa bed for the companion, has only one chair. According to what they said: It's just that there was no other room available for me at the time.In the morning, I received a visit from the doctor on duty, very attentive, who asked: did you eat? Did you go to the bathroom? It was almost 7:30 in the morning and I hadn't had breakfast or gone to the bathroom - still drowsy, in no condition. Only when she requested did breakfast come (it arrived without cutlery, it seemed to have been thrown on the tray), but it did come.There is a noticeable rush for the patient to be discharged and important details are lost.

At this point I would like to leave my report on the topic. My father is in a wheelchair and was in a wheelchair when I went to take him for an appointment on the 9th of July. We were 6 minutes late (checked by the attendant using the printed password) when we sat down to check in. Almost at the same moment, the doctor's secretary said that she wouldn't be able to see us because of the delay. At that moment I thought: -Did I hit my head against the wall and forget that I live in England? The attendant said: -He is in a wheelchair! The answer remained negative. I'm totally in favor of punctuality, but in a country where the start of the wedding is always printed on the invitation 1 hour in advance, I'm sure you know that neither I, much less you, have the morality to have this type of behavior. Even more so being a hospital. Even more so, the well-being of people being your responsibility and PRODUCT.

I was discharged on 4/18.The hospital asked me to arrive three hours in advance. I arrived at 10:40, my surgery was scheduled for 2:00. Ok. I arrived, they attended to me, filled out everything I needed, signed everything I needed and hence my surprise! They would come and pick me up (I was at the admission reception) at around 1:00 pm! Lol, I looked at the girl and said: ""Lie!"" But it's good. Let's wait! They only came to pick me up at 1:30 pm! In ""preparation"" for surgery I had to do everything quickly. And despite the fact that the day before they called me asking for information (including, I informed them that I don't eat meat, only meat, any meat, any animals. Derived from animals, yes. I made this information clear to the guy who called me) They didn't inform me that I couldn't wear contact lenses. I found out there, right away, in preparation for the surgery! I have 8 and a half degrees of hyperopia and 3.5 of astigmatism. Without a lens, I can't see!!! And I didn't even imagine that the lenses could have any relationship with the gallbladder! Anyway... Okay! Let's go to surgery!Post-surgery, I was very well looked after by the nursing team! Very attentive. I even had an episode of a lot of pain and they promptly attended to me! I was also well looked after in the room. I had another episode of pain, they promptly medicated me! In the early hours of the morning, I requested a change of access (it was painful), and they changed it. Only a 10 for the nursing team!My question was with the nutritionist. The meal they sent me had chicken and fish. My sister (companion) called the nurse and asked to change the meal. A while later (I was groggy from pain medication) the phone in the room rang, it was the nutritionist. My sister answered and told her that I didn't eat meat. The nutritionist asked ""what does she eat?"" My sister gave me the phone and the same question... I explained that I just didn't eat meat. All other foods, such as: any vegetable, any vegetable, any root: any grain, oats, milk, any fruit, cheese, egg, yogurt, rice, beans, like! I found it strange that a nutritionist didn't understand the concept of ""animal meat!"", as I made clear to the attendant who called me the day before. But it's good! I don't want to judge anyone and I know that everyone has a day when they're not so great. Maybe the nutritionist was just having a bad day. I don't know. But it is a point that I make so that you can check and that you already have pre-made menus. In my case it was simple: rice, beans, a vegetable and a boiled egg would be great for me!Anyway... thank you for your attention and care!"

Triage nurse named SAMUEL, is extremely arrogant, arrogant and has no ethics whatsoever to be there triaging patients. When taking my loved one to this service, the nurse SAMUEL, when carrying out the screening, provides untrue information, as the patient has a pre-existing disease and, in order to triage quickly, he puts in the system that the patient does not have any disease, and the worst is in the place where Allergies must be informed, he writes “NEGA”, and the patient has a drug allergy and this information when suppressed in the system puts the patient at risk/danger, this type of act should even be treated as criminal since it puts the patient's life at risk/danger and the nurse assumes the risk with his intentional intent, because if the hospital's procedure is to provide exact information and the nurse does not do so for reasons who know not why, he intentionally assumes the risk. Not to mention that patients may have a very high pain score, high blood pressure and complain that they cannot handle the pain, that Mr. Samuel does not even send the patient to the so-called pain protocol, stating that the symptom and the The patient's report is no big deal. Unfortunately, the 9th of July, with these terrible professionals who are on the front line, will receive a flood of complaints, as in the past, excellence in care, patient well-being, good education and humanized care, things that nowadays This is not seen even remotely in the services provided by this hospital, since the patients who seek the services offered there pay and pay very dearly for their plans or private individuals so that we can immediately have a half-assed service in the triage, with frivolous information that does not match with the reality of that patient. I still look closely at all the screening and everything that is placed in the system, now if it is done this way with us, how many more patients must have been placed or will untrue information be placed in the system at the time of screening? I hope that those responsible follow the screening and stop giving employees a “wash” and return with the excellent service that was a differentiator on July 9th and is no longer the case today."

And that he even insisted that they say that the dressing is clean and that the request for this change would also be included in the post-surgical report.That's what I did when I arrived at the apartment, I asked the nurses to change the dressing as recommended by the doctor, the nurse's response was immediate saying that the dressing was clean and then I had to respond saying that it was the doctor's recommendation and it was even in the report for her to check.They ended up agreeing to make the change, but then something very unusual happened: one of the materials that would be used to change the dressing was missing and they had to ask to buy it. Oops, missing material to make a bandage???? I found it very strange for a hospital of H9J's caliber to have this type of unforeseen event.Time passed and it was time for discharge at 9:30 pm and I was already more than tired from being in the hospital for more than 6 hours. I spoke to the nurses who had already decided that I would leave without changing the dressing.Then they replied that they were already making arrangements [I had arrived at the shelter apartment +/- 7:30 pm]. I said I didn't need it anymore.I could be wrong but the feeling I had from the beginning about the situation was that the ward staff did NOT want to change the dressing, that's why I'm posting this fact here, after all we are paying dearly for the plan and also so that the management of the hospital is aware and can take the necessary measures if they are interested.Before I forget, the surgery body was excellent. Only the infirmary in the safe ward left me suspicious."

Easy access, good professionals in various sectors, from reception, security, imaging exams. Between nurses and doctors, there are good ones and others not so much. A lot has changed with the new administration, here's a suggestion for H9 not to fall into the trap of outsourcing many sectors and reducing the number of employees or replacing them with others who have less experience and who accept any salary. In fact, it is important to place more intensive care physicians and nurses in the P.S. and also on the floors. Satisfied customers will return whenever necessary and recommend them to many people, this will generate much more revenue than payroll costs. The opposite is true, if quality drops too much, corporate clients will terminate contracts and revenue will quickly disappear. I hope they make wise decisions and that the hospital can progress every day. My family and I were well looked after overall. They seek the best treatment, respecting patients’ choices."

As a patient, client and consumer, I feel deeply harmed by this situation that has worsened since 2021.It is extremely frustrating to deal with frequent and incorrect charges, especially when the error lies in the lack of communication between the hospital and the health plan. This recurring failure in the billing system places an additional burden on patients and their families, who are already facing challenging times in terms of their health and well-being.In addition to the financial impact, these undue charges also generate a significant emotional burden. The constant uncertainty regarding the amounts charged and the need to constantly contest such charges only increases the already existing stress and worry.I sincerely ask that Hospital Nove de Julho and the company Dasa recognize the seriousness of this situation and adopt effective measures to correct these billing problems. It is essential that there is transparency, agility and responsibility in the treatment of financial issues related to patients, in order to provide quality service and respect for consumer rights.As a customer and patient, I have the right to receive reliable and fair healthcare without the additional distress and pressure caused by undue charges. I hope that my message is heard and that the necessary measures are taken to resolve this recurring problem.Yours sincerely,Patient/consumer/client: Valdene Cravo de Melo Abreu - Wife."

I came to Peixoto Gomide tonight for him to be admitted to undergo 2 tests because, as he is a special patient, he needs to be sedated and in a hospital environment. The first service was excellentBut when the doctor arrived, a neurologist Matheus. He said he spoke to the gastro and that he didn't see the need to hospitalize him, since my son's condition has been going on for 2 years and it's not urgent. Seriously, right? It's not urgent because he's not his son. I complained and got admitted.  That was 1:40 in the morning.  So far, the hospitalization has not been confirmed, they claimed that my insurance is taking a long time. That's a lie, because he's been hospitalized twice this year and in different hospitals and it didn't take that long. I went to the hospital and the employee Alexandre said he called the insurance company and there was no system. It may even be that at some point it actually was. But since before 2 am and you haven't called there again? In other words, now that they have made the appropriate request. And another, I didn't know that my son is a special patient.  Total lack of respect!! It is now almost 9 am and the health insurance company called and said that it does not authorize hospitalization due to the clinical picture that the doctor reported and that the hospital only requested admission at 6:50 am, which was the time I I went to complain.  This is absurd. I want to see who will reimburse me for the wasted hours I spent here and still pay a fortune for parking."

Unbelievable!!Fortunately, a nursing assistant on the first floor of the orthopedics station helped us in a very humane way and managed to solve it and the doctor was very good, it wasn't their mistake but the service's.....and here I am waiting for my mother to take the medication, here on the ground floor, I just saw a man, in pain in a wheelchair, also guided in the wrong way... this man, who was alone, had already been waiting for almost an hour and a half and no one noticed, because what I saw most here were attendants talking about everything and didn't realize that he had already been called several times and that he was in pain.....

Even though he said he would come down in two minutes and I would wait at reception, they didn't let me. They said the system doesn't allow it. Are you a hospital or a system? They stuck empathy and notion in the c#'s eye. I left without seeing my friend who almost died and was only allowed a visit now due to isolation. Not to mention the medication that he said he was allergic to and they gave him because he had anaphylaxis.

The cleaning left something to be desired, we spent a whole day without any cleaning. Delay in sending the first bottle, but then it went well. Children's food is good but you have to use adult cutlery, which makes it difficult and even dangerous (due to the fork). We are now in the room, here is the servicefell 90%. There isn't even any baby soap as we are on a floor only for children, there wasn't even any water in the room, imagine the rest, everything you have to ask for, but considering the lack of baby soap I don't think my baby will even have a blanket, in short it's horrible.

Furthermore, my pain was reduced, as if I were in the hospital for a walk. Terrible humanity and listening. I don't recommend it.Unfortunately, I had to give this low rating because I'm still in pain and feeling like crap after the appointment.I know this is not the hospital's standard. The receptionists and nurses are lovely, very helpful, human and careful. It is regrettable that this individual who attended to me is more financially valued in the hospital, and those who carry the place and keep me coming back are: the service, nursing and reception staff.A special affection for the triage nurse Pamela, for Bruna who schedules the exams and for the nurse who was in the waiting room.- Victor (Password OR00010)"

What leaves a lot to be desired is the slowness of the service. Inside the hospital, the logistics look more like a fancy public hospital. My service lasted 4 hours. If I had been in a UPA, it would have been almost the same thing. I do not recommend this hospital. Spending more than three hours in pain? Have holy patience!!!!"

Thank God at that time another doctor came, asked for a test and found the infection (Clostridium bacteria), it may be that my husband was already cured, he wouldn't need to be admitted to Santa Catarina, because on the 9th of July with this Dr, no way. ..The ombudsman cared little about what happened, that's what they do, they just record it and nothing resolves it... TERRIBLE patient advisory service.There is nothing more to discuss with the OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE, everything has already been done, they had to give a response in ""4 days"", they simply did NOT give the slightest importance, in other words, that's it... they respond here as if it were going to be resolved haha"

However, to my surprise and disappointment, a lot has changed. I went to the hospital on the 9th of July because I had been sleepless with a fever of 38.3 to 38.9 for 4 days and not even Novalgina 1000mg gave any results, severe flu, cough, sore throat, headache, body aches and completely congested, that was what was reported in the screening and to the doctor on duty last Saturday. The doctor didn't examine my throat, ignored the Covid test I requested, gave me an X-ray and some blood tests (which showed nothing in the results) to do and that was that. He prescribed me Predsim, Loratadine, Dipirona 500mg, Onoex. AND THE GREAT DETAIL: A PRESCRIPTION WITH 2 COPIES, HOWEVER, 1 COPY FROM ONE DOCTOR AND THE SECOND COPY FROM ANOTHER DOCTOR. AND WITHOUT DATE. Like this? Please explain to me. Today is Tuesday and I'm still feeling bad. I was seen at 9:42 am last Saturday, my tests and results were all ready between 10:20 am and 11:00 am, however I felt ill inside the hospital waiting in a closed waiting room from 10:20 am until 2 pm with other patients who could even contract the same strong flu and fever (they put them all together without instructions), when I decided to go into the office and tell them that I had been waiting since the morning to get feedback on my exams, they still asked me to wait a few more minutes, if Another 40 minutes passed and she was not seeing any patients, she was with two other doctors talking in her room about the IT system, I recorded it with my cell phone. I was without any medication and extremely weak and without sleep the night before, waiting for more than 3 and a half hours in a private hospital. The Ombudsman has already been notified, I kindly ask you not to send me automatic messages. If there is still any concern or concern for the health of your patients, my personal contacts have been registered at this hospital for years, demonstrate it in practice, it is the least they should do."

I had an emergency and went to Hospital 9 de Julho. Because my health insurance wasn't registered in their portfolio, they made me wait for hours and hours before taking a decision. My health insurance sent them a guarantee letter, which is the praxis in the field, they didn't accept it. Then my insurance said: make an invoice and we pay immediately. Hours later the answer was - we don't make invoices. There were no trust or responsibility whatsoever from the administrative staff of the hospital, which is a shame given that the medical practictioners were excellent at all times. In a nutshell: I arrived at the hospital at 9 pm of Thursday, my surgery was schedule to 6 am of the day after and until 10 am nothing had happened. It was only when we filed a personal card for a total of 21,000 reais (over 4k usd) that my process moved forward. I strongly recommend that if you don't have an insurance registered with them, DO NOT GO THERE."

I recognize the excellence of the hospital and its professionals. However, I had some eye exams in October, November and December 2021, the results of which were not delivered to me. I was contacted by the hospital's SAC after complaining about the incident and received a protocol with a login and password for a website so that I could print the results. To my surprise, on the website there are several identical exams carried out on the same date, reports with a different date on which the exam was carried out and even with a changed name. As a layman, I was unable to correctly identify which results should be printed. When I contacted the hospital's ombudsman, I received an email address to which I should send the request to retrieve the results. It seems that the ombudsman's office has not realized the importance of taking action regarding this situation, the gravity of which goes beyond the pure and simple delivery of results. Will I receive the correct results, as there are several with the same date? Which one is correct? Will erroneously dated/named reports be corrected? I make what happened public because I like the hospital and want to remain a customer, but situations like this call into question the quality of services provided from the beginning to the end of the care."

In addition to carrying out their activities with mastery, they were able to share with us guidance, motivation, cordiality, smiles, friendliness, education, etc....At a time when we are fragile, I say that this makes all the difference in the patient's recovery because it is good for us to have these sensations.And when I talk about the professionals, they are all nurses, technicians, cleaners, pantry staff, nutritionists, physiotherapists...

The doctor gives a urine test at 10:30 am, you only return to the doctor to find out the results at 2 pm.When the doctor doesn't know what it's about because he changed the shift and asked for a CT scan, not knowing what to do, he puts a tramal in the vein for pain at 5:40 pm, you're not seen until 6:50 pm. Knowing that if the pain doesn't go away you will be hospitalized because they don't even suspect what you have.Look, it's barbaric!Life lesson, to never set foot here in this place again.

This time, I was on the other side. I am a urologist at this hospital. In a way, I know well the phases that the patient goes through, from reception to the surgical center. Everything in the pre-operative period is done following excellent protocols, as is done in the best hospitals in the world.It all started with the choice of my friend, the general surgeon, Prof. Dr. Rodrigo Surjan. The result could not have been any other, a success. H9J was one of the first hospitals in São Paulo that understood the importance of robotic surgery and believed in the success of this surgical approach. Today, many hospital surgeons perform it and it is a surgery performed routinely, especially for abdominal surgeries.Since arriving at the hospital, I have been integrated into the institution's many specialists and services. Today I have many friends and I participate in weekly scientific meetings. Furthermore, I would very much like to thank you for the care that was given so that I could have a better evolution intra- and post-operatively. Thank you very much to everyone who directly or indirectly helped me to go through the reconstructive surgery unharmed and comfortably. My recovery occurred without any complications and I was ready to return to my activities.</p><p>The hospital is always looking for new paths of medical innovation, bringing its implementation into everyday life. New technologies are being used in different specialties. Therefore, many colleagues who work at the hospital practice high-level medicine, carrying out innovative treatments.In addition to doctors, all team members, nurses, physiotherapists, nutritionists and all other services work towards the success of the patient's treatment. Many weekly meetings are held weekly to align the conduct of these teams.Therefore, I am grateful for the recovery of my health. Therefore, when you have to choose where to be treated, rest assured that we will all be ready to lend a helping hand.Thank you very much for your kindness, Hospital 9 de Julho, great honor to be part of your clinical team. </p>"

However, after the measurement, due to the shift change, my wife and I waited for more than an hour to not be seen by the doctor on duty, that's right, not to be seen. This was due to the doctor who took care of her incident, who was attending to an emergency, of course, and so emergency care must be a priority, but to my surprise, there was only one other doctor available to assist in the emergency room, and my wife was not attended to because the incident was with the doctor who was providing emergency services. We waited for more than an hour, people and more people came to the front for assistance, and we left at around 3:40 in the morning without her undergoing a final assessment. Therefore, whoever goes to the hospital on July 9th in the early hours of the morning in the emergency room, be careful, THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH DOCTORS TO CARE FOR. My daughter Ana Clara Cabral Puchetti recently underwent a surgical procedure and received exceptional care, but after yesterday, I don't know if I'll return. Oh, in addition to paying 60.00 for parking. At the very least, I hope to hear from this hospital again."

I would like to express my sincere thanks to all nurses and nursing technicians or assistants. Especially the dearest AMANDA LEAL...who in her turn took care of my daughter with lots of love and respect. She is fantastic and knows how to carry out her professional role properly without forgetting the humanitarian aspect. Very human, very attentive, very sweet. I hope I never have to stay with my daughter in hospital again, but if that is the case I will make a point of asking AMANDA LEAL to assist us.I have no complaints about the hospital itself...I have always received very good care...admission was arranged quickly.WORST SIDE - However, I was disappointed with the DR. DANILO DALLAGO DE MARCHI, as he wanted to charge me an amount separate from the agreement, which covered the entire procedure. He said he would bring an anesthesia professional, who even introduced me after the surgery, and charged me in the family room at the surgical center the amount of 200.00 for the anesthetist's work. This in front of the entire medical staff who had just performed my daughter's surgery. However, I refused to pay, as I was instructed by my insurance company not to pay anything out of pocket, because the insurance policy covered the entire procedure.He claimed that HOSPITAL 9 DE JULHO would not have such a professional.I ask the internal affairs department to investigate the facts, because this denigrates the image of the HOSPITAL."

The consultation was so-so, because despite making a great assessment, the doctor did not have a very appropriate attitude. But the problem isn't there. As the consultation was private, we had 30 days to return. My mother had an average of 6 different tests including blood, ultrasounds, X-rays, tomography and resonance. The last result will be ready on September 20th, exactly 30 days after her consultation. I called the hospital to try to schedule it for the 21st to go with all the exams and it was denied. In other words, I paid 435 reais for a consultation and I don't have the right to take the exams THIRTY-ONE days after the consultation? I've had other private consultations and, due to exams, companies are more flexible. I wasn't asking for a consultation 40 or 60 days after the deadline, but just 1 day, due to an exam. Your rigid stance and without the slightest chance of negotiation are regrettable. You won't see my money there ever again!!"

Yes, I knew, however the two ladies who were attending were not organized at all and mixed up the documents.After waiting 1:20h, I went to ask and one of them told me that only 1 priority passed in front.Ok, another 30 minutes of waiting, I asked again and although I was next, my son's document still had some documents in front of it. I asked again: are you serving people who arrived at 10:40 am, I arrived at 9:00 am: 50h.Without looking me in the face and pretending that everything was fine, the other lady (who ended up helping me) simply said: oh, the doctor must have removed the order when she came here.Without an apology or anything... Not to mention that my son's document had been there for 2 hours and it was only at the time of my appointment that we found out that he couldn't donate because he wasn't yet 16 years old.In other words, I took my son to donate blood (even though I couldn't donate), to have the experience that it is an easy and good thing and he has this experience.To realize that the order was wrong, all she had to do was look at my arrival label and look at the label of the person at her table... She didn't need to believe me or not, just look at the label (perhaps difficult for her, as she didn't He didn’t even look at my face to talk to me, right).I only completed the donation because my son had made a commitment to the mother of a friend of his, but in truth, I only return to this hospital in an extreme situation, because of my own free will, honestly not.And I'm just wasting a little more time in my day on this subject (I also sent an email to the hospital) because blood donation is a very important thing to be treated with the spite that I saw in this hospital today."

Many times I had to hear something similar: I'm not racist, I even have black friends.It's really hard to live in a country that doesn't recognize itself, that practices racism in a perverse and cowardly way!!!  What doesn't kill me makes me stronger!!!I vented, I spoke very calmly and serenely, I returned the taste of bile and the pain that for some time made me feel bad... racism, prejudice and discrimination is the problem of those who have it!!!
