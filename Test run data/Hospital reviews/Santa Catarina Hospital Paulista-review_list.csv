Santa Catarina Hospital Paulista,"Av. Paulista, 200 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Paulo Mesquita,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",8 hours ago,"Today, 12/05/2024, in the early hours of the morning, I got in touch before coming to this hospital, to confirm whether the orthopedic emergency room was available for my Sulamerica plan (Classico SA Apartment). I was told yes. When I arrived, in addition to making me go to the wrong places within the hospital and after doing the screening (I only spent 30 minutes in pain there), they informed me that my plan did not have coverage. In short, waste of time, misinformation, total lack of respect."

Santa Catarina Hospital Paulista,"Av.

Lack of respect! In time, this is the second time this has happened to me. Next time I will bring a lunch box if the hospital prefers, although this cost will certainly be included in the amount charged to Sul América."

Santa Catarina Hospital Paulista,"Av. Paulista, 200 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Rafael Gomide,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",a week ago,"A relative has been admitted to this hospital for a few weeks. It has already been admitted to the hospital and ICU, and the problem is the same: poor service, patients are not monitored (not even in the ICU), waiting for care for hours and nursing teams without adequate training and overworked. There is a lack of management in the hospital as a whole. My advice is if you have other options, don't go to this hospital, especially if the patient is bedridden, in need of a lot of help, because they are abandoned by the nurses, they are only treated if the companion ""makes a mess"" - a real absurdity.AVOID THIS HOSPITAL. The patient remains abandoned in bed, even if he is a critical patient."

From the welcoming architecture, which creates a peaceful environment, to the excellent service provided by the reception team and security guards, everything contributed to a very positive experience.I was particularly impressed by the care and attention of the nurses, always ready to welcome and offer support. The waiting time was surprisingly short, and the exams were carried out with great care and precision. I would especially like to praise the doctors in the specialties of urology and orthopedics (knee), who were attentive to my complaints, reviewed my previous exams, carried out necessary tests and requested new exams in a very careful way.It is rare to find such complete and humanized care, where we really feel that our pain and impacts on quality of life are taken into consideration.

A hospital of this size with an orthopedist on duty (Dr. Victor Veras), care after screening lasting 45 minutes to make a record, with only 3 employees to attend to abattalion of patients. After 3 hours of being seen, analyzed and X-ray results, the medication was administered incorrectly and no one can find the doctor to resolve it. The hospital was not full, unbelievable as at EVERY stage this place is terrifying :). Opening a complaint with the Omint operator as well. This hospital needs to be closed and redone from scratch."

My wife had intense headaches, a lot of coughing and weakness. Even though we requested priority service, since we have a baby in arms (9 months) we had to wait 2 hours for service! And we were only attended to because we made a complaint. The priority only served to let the MAJORITY of patients who arrived after us be seen earlier. At the very least, this is disrespectful. To make matters worse, the initial registration stated that she would be treated by orthopedics. Terrible."

Santa Catarina Hospital Paulista,"Av. Paulista, 200 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Adriana Tavares Vinhas,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",4 weeks ago,"The hospital was good, they even put me at serasa, due to a dengue test that my plan didn't cover and they didn't tell me when the test was taking, they carried out the test they didn't tell me that the plan didn't cover it or what the value. On the same day I stayed in the hospital from 11 am until 6 pm. Being the biggest disregard for the people there, the doctor took more than 1 hour and a half to see me just to check the exam, I went to take medication and the nurse said I would be hospitalized, even though she didn't even know my name , it took more than 35 minutes to help me, and then to say that I was going to take an IV, I gave up waiting and ended up leaving.  Today, due to R$173.00, my name is on serasa because at the time of taking the exam, they did not inform me that the exam was not covered by the plan and I would have to take it. In short, rubbish service, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, lack of professionalism on the part of professionals in the field. It was not there being served by the SUS but by the health plan, and they still make a big deal out of people. I will always report and complain so that no one goes through what I went through. This type of service is ridiculous, and if the exam cost 3 thousand reais, I wouldn't be notified and would have to take it, without even knowing that the plan wouldn't cover it. Lack of professionalism of attendants."

From the other complaints, I saw that this is the least of it, because in person, even if they mistreat the patient and a so-called Christian hospital, it seems like they are trying to kill those who want to be treated. I don't understand how a hospital isn't ashamed of being like this, anyone who speaks badly about the SUS is quite innocent, because even privately, in the agreement, there is this kind of nasty thing to do with patients. What kind of Christianity is there in there? The complaints don't stop, there's a serious problem there!"

However, I was there on 10/14/2024, to undergo a delicate surgery to remove Cholesteatoma in the right ear. I was admitted early on Monday, at 4am. There was no one in the large reception area. I was looked after very well by an employee called Valéria, who talked to me a lot and explained various features of the hospital. My stay at Sta. Catarina was from 4am until 8pm on 10/14 and I loved it. I was treated very well by everyone, from the friendly receptionist to all the post-operative staff, nurses, nursing technicians, etc. Everything was explained very well to me. The food was also very good and I really enjoyed the cassava and potato soups, as well as the afternoon coffee with tea, biscuits and bread. Rating 10! If, by chance, I need to undergo a new surgery or really need to go to a hospital, Sta. Catarina will be my reference. I'm from São Bernardo do Campo and this hospital simply put all the hospitals I know in the ABC region to shame, especially the Rede D'or hospitals. My congratulations to the Hosp employees and managers. St. Catherine."

I was instructed to wait in the ""Family Space"" room and remained there for more than 4 hours. After approximately 1 and a half hours, the doctor came to inform me that the procedure had been successful and that in approximately 1 to 1 and a half hours my wife would be moved to the room and I would be notified.However, after this period, I called the surgery center and was informed that I should continue to wait, as my wife was still recovering. Another hour passed and I called again. This time, the employees seemed to be disoriented and did not know how to report the situation. After several questions between them, they said they would check and get back. A few minutes later, I was told the room number, where my wife had been staying for over half an hour and was also trying to locate me, having asked several times to let me know where she was.Furthermore, my wife had not eaten for over 14 hours and after asking several times, she finally received her meal. Before that, a professional entered the room looking for another patient, which reinforced the feeling of disorganization.In short, except for the doctor, some professionals seem to need more training and guidance."

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE after the procedure (which I didn't even perform in the Surgical Center), it was with local anesthesia to remove a small cyst on my back, with Dr. Marcela Benatti (plastic), where I didn't need to be under observation and was sent straight home! This procedure was fully covered by my health plan according to the hospital, however, even so, upon admission I indicated on the due sheets that I would not accept any private charges. Well, after almost 2 months a bill arrives from the hospital saying that I am in debt to them for not paying for 2 (TWO) STERILE MARKING PENS that the insurance did not cover! (???) (Why???). I have been a nurse for 30 years in the Surgical Center and Day Clinic, I know that the Doctor used 1 pen to mark the small cyst (this was before preparing me for the procedure). I also know that this pen fixes on the skin, facilitating the surgical procedure, that is, it is completely clear of where the incision or “cut” will be made! Mrs. Victoria from the hospital's finance department told me that regardless of whether they told me that the procedure was fully covered by the plan or even whether I had indicated on papers upon admission, that I was OBLIGED TO PAY this debt. I am STARRED by this hospital that I gave preference to and because it is also a Christian hospital, they now treat me with a total lack of respect, lack of commitment, they think the customer is ignorant and they make ABSURD AND IMPROPER CHARGES!!!I will certainly pursue my legal rights, as I don't think it's fair to be treated like a fool by the institution I trusted and was betrayed!

He didn't provide correct information about the exit to the underground, he was rude, he shouted and when he cut my bracelet, he cut my wrist with non-sterilized scissors and he didn't apologize, he shouted saying: there girl, I turned the scissors upwards!Even though I calmly pointed out that it hurt, she didn't apologize and continued to be rude when giving the information about leaving. If you have cameras with audio you will see how the incident happened.  The problem was not the ""accident"" that could occur, but rather the lack of education, and then not worrying that we were in a hospital and I needed to sterilize the injured area and this was not offered. I left, because my husband insistently asked me to stay calm, since I'm sick, but I think that nonsense like this can't go unnoticed, because she could do it to other people, even more weak than me.Please, I want clarification from the hospital. Attached is a photo of the cut he made on my wrist.

I QUESTION: WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS HOSPITAL, which was said to be a reference in its differentiated service? I'm really realizing how different he is. RESULT: If today they don't give me a solution to my case, tomorrow I will file a lawsuit with Small Claims, for compensation due to so much time lost, in addition to my health problem having worsened during this period."

Good evening, I don't know if this is the correct channel of communication, but if not, please forward it to those responsible. On 8/22/2024 I arrived at Hospital Santa Catarina at 5:04 pm. My appointment, I mean filling out the forms and signatures, took place at 7:02 pm. Absurd. I'm a priority, I announced that I was in very severe pain, limping and yet I waited all this time. I noticed that several people also arrived around this time.They waited “almost two hours” for assistance, resulting in total organizational unpreparedness on the part of the team. There is a lack of effective management, with a critical look at patients, the vast majority of whom are elderly, with serious difficulties, requiring fast, humane and efficient care. The big problem is the logistical ramifications. First: screening, then filling out the forms, then referral to doctors, for exams, if necessary, followed by waiting for the call for exams, after waiting for the results of the exams to be completed. exams (very willingly two hours), and waiting for the doctor's reevaluation!!!!!!! There is no one who can take it! After insisting a lot, I managed to go through all these steps and FINALLY be seen for re-evaluation by the doctor at 00:06. That is, I spent exactly seven hours and two minutes to receive the medical diagnosis! ABSURD!!!!!I would like, or rather demand, an immediate response regarding the “disrespect” to which I was subjected.Maria Aparecida Orsini"

I made an appointment with Dr. Simone Elisa Dutenhefner at 2:20 p.m. I arrived early when I went to reception and was told that the Dr. usually takes a while to respond. So far ok, but the delay was too long and I asked reception about the queue for service countless times and the answer was always the same: The doctor takes a long time to provide service and you're next. This went on until 6pm, I complained again and the receptionist went to check.What's my surprise? The Doctor left! He says he didn't see that I had been waiting 4 hours!  The biggest negligence and absurdity I have ever experienced!I was warned by Ana Paula Costa andAna Paula Bueno who would no longer receive care because neither Dr. Simone nor another Dr. were present!I lost my working day, my time was spent commuting and not being attended to due to neglect and disorganization!I want an answer about this loss! In addition to the embarrassment that I spent hours begging for assistance, for an answer!Is this the type of care this hospital offers?This neglect with a consultation, let alone with any major procedure!I felt humiliated!

She only knew about the referral for surgery.In short: I was diagnosed with pneumonia, intestinal infections, and I already have gallstones.I spent almost 12 hours in a hospital sitting in chairs that were not comfortable. Going back and forth doing tests and taking medication, so that in the end, I heard that I couldn't have an operation because I had infections and it would be risky.You need to improve your PS, a hospital of this size has problems that we sometimes don't even see in public hospitals.

I was soon called for screening and then to open the file. This all happened in approximately 15 minutes. So far, everything is perfect.30 minutes passed, 50 minutes passed, 1:20 hours passed, I decided to go to the attendant who opened my file and asked what was happening, because in 1 hour and 20 minutes, I had only called 1 SR password... mine was SR0075 , and the only password called in all this time was the password RS00073. I really didn't understand the dynamics of the passwords, as they didn't call any patient for medical care.  The attendant informed me that they had 5 passwords in front of me. I was outraged, because if in 1 hour and 20 minutes they had only called a password, I would have to wait hours and hours to be called.  The attendant said she couldn't do anything, as her obligation had already been done.  She instructed me to look for the nursing desk inside the hospital. I went to the counter and explained the situation to a nurse who was there. She asked me to wait and went to the PS reception. She came back saying what I already knew, that there were 5 people in front of me, and that I would have to wait, as she could also do absolutely nothing to resolve the situation. I went back to reception and waited until 11:00 pm... no password was called during that time.  As I had a lot of headache due to a sinus infection, and my throat was infected, I decided to leave, even though I felt very bad and in a lot of pain, as I couldn't bear to wait a few more hours to be seen.This is not the first time that I have had a bad experience at this Hospital.My indignation is that Hospital Santa Catarina claims to offer ""humanized"" care. If this is humanized care, I don't even want to experience ""dehumanized"" care.Disrespect and disregard for patients’ health. SUS offers better care than Hospital Santa Catarina.It's sad to see a hospital that was once one of the best in São Paulo, providing horrible and inhumane care like what has been happening lately.May God allow me to NEVER need to enter this horrible hospital again."

I entered the hospital in a bad way and left worse than when I entered.Well, I arrived around 10pm, feeling very nauseous, headache and fever. First let's face the fact that it took me more than 1 hour to register. But anyway. The doctor (who was very attentive) said that, given the duration of the symptoms, he wouldn't detect dengue fever yet, if it were. But he prescribed medication to alleviate the pain and, if it persisted, we would take other measures. So far, everything is ok! He evaluated me correctly, performed auscultation, and even performed a meningitis test. So I went to take the medications. That's where it all started. The nurse applied the medication outside my vein. It was burning a lot when applied and it immediately became swollen. But she continued and only then stopped. But she said no, that the medicine was correct. I stayed there, under observation, with my arm burning, with unbearable pain... I waited for it to take effect, the doctor (again, very attentive) realized that the medication really wasn't in the vein. And, of course, I'm only getting worse. In addition to the symptoms persisting, my arm was now hurting, swollen and burning. So he administered the medicine orally, because I was afraid they would miss the vein again. Amazingly, it took me more than an hour to take two pills. In the meantime, I started to feel much more ill. Then the doctor said that I really couldn't take it orally anymore, because it wouldn't help, I would just throw it out. Conclusion: I left the hospital without taking the correct medication, and worse: with an extravasated vein and my arm hurting. In addition to being much worse than the other symptoms."

The team doesn't seem to communicate, it seems like no one knows what's going on, the space is confusing, poorly marked and you're left wandering around the hospital until you see the doctor.On Saturday I stayed from 12:30 until 6:30 pm to get a blood test, and when I arrived it was almost empty. This is all because after waiting 3 hours, I discovered that they had forgotten to put my form in for return.Today I arrived at 2:30 pm and saw a harsh doctor who didn't take me seriously, treated me as if I was lying about my symptoms and didn't even explain what tests he had ordered or the medications I was going to take. The result was pain medication that I didn't want to take and no serum, even though I almost couldn't do the blood test because I was dehydrated and the blood simply wouldn't come out. While waiting for us to return, the nurse informed us that the ward we were in had already closed and took people to another waiting room, by which time it was already 7:00 pm. When I realized that they weren't going to call anytime soon, I left without returning.I don't recommend it to anyone. Any hospital with a real internal communication system is better than this."

In the midst of a time of contagious and dangerous diseases, the professional who treated me failed to order two simple tests to diagnose my problem. I took a COVID and influenza test, but x-ray and dengue, he said I didn't need it. That he thought it wasn't any of those illnesses. He said that dengue fever presents other symptoms, that whooping cough doesn't occur in adults and that my lungs were fine. At night, when I underwent an online reassessment, carried out by another doctor from the same hospital, he said that I would have to take a dengue test and it is an x-ray because I have had a fever for 3 days, cough, chest pain , head and body and a lot of shortness of breath, and I didn't understand why the doctor who saw me in the morning hadn't asked, because the symptoms of illnesses are different in each individual. Conclusion: They wanted to send me home straight away to avoid contact with various viruses and I needed to go back for an appointment again, even with the test requests in hand. Total nonsense! Negligence, lack of respect for human beings. I understand that the demand is great, but this doctor needs to understand that his opinion is not always right. It is better to err on the side of excess than lack of care. Very sad, because I love Santa Catarina and every time I needed it, I was treated very well!"

I have nothing to complain about this hospital, today I live more than 60km away and I insisted on getting a second medical opinion by going to Santa Catarina. Regarding the “delay in service” I have already waited more than 4 hours to be seen (I had the flu), but they prioritize those who REALLY need it. The delay is often due to doctors attending the ICU, ICU, ambulances arriving, I've been in the room and in the middle of the consultation the doctor runs out. But I just had a headache. I put myself in my shoes, if it were a relative of mine in need, would I complain when the doctor rushed to the ICU? So I hope well."

When I arrived it was 11:40, I passed the screening at 12:10, I went to the 1st floor to open the form, there were two rooms, which I believed to be one for respiratory symptoms and the other not, HOWEVER, THE TWO ROOMS ARE FOR PATIENTS OF RESPIRATORY CHECKS OR NOT!!(Although the pandemic taught us to wear masks properly and maintain better social distancing, this hospital forgot that.... It's unfortunate that you go to treat something unrelated to the respiratory condition and leave there with a virus.)OPENING THE FORM: Until then, despite being indignant, I was also in pain, so it took another 2 hours to open the form, by then it was already 2:30 pm, and I hadn't even been seen by the doctor yet.MEDICAL ATTENTION: Another 1 hour and 30 minutes passed and I was finally seen, with some questions from the Dr. and he didn't even tell me which medication I would receive, even though he knew that I was already taking pain medication, he only prescribed me semtamol and buscopan (it was like water).NURSING: So, after the medication, the nurse who administered it didn't pay attention to diluting the ondasentrona and put it directly into the vein, almost poorly diluted, which caused me great discomfort and tachycardia, I'm in the healthcare field and I was left feeling helpless. with this conduct; In addition to what happened, she didn't even pay attention to the fact that the prescription included a urine and blood test, even though I questioned and insisted, even then she denied having it, until I spoke to another nurse (when she came out and she saw at the back that it really was prescribed), so he had to punish me again, the lack of qualifications was absurd.IMAGE EXAMINATION: As soon as the medication was finished it was around 3:30 pm, so I went to the tomography room which took another 1 hour there, meaning I returned to the waiting room still in pain.WAITING: I told the nurses that the pain had not gone away, they said that they would take my file to the Dr.'s office, so I went back to the waiting room.In the waiting room, several companions sat with the patient, and more than 1 companion, often per person, sitting together without having any justification for this, and patients standing, including me, some companions even sleeping.RELEASE: I stood waiting for around 4 hours, I went to ask the nurses several times, including about my pain, and there were always many people complaining and demanding a behavior from the nurses, due to the delay and lack of care at this hospital, in the end they They had placed my file in an empty office, from which I observed this myself and spoke to them, so one of them transferred my care to office 08 and the doctor barely looked at my tests and sent me home with pain medication.When I got home I had an acute pancreatitis attack, I did telemedicine and I'm going to be hospitalized due to a pancreatitis referral.Hospital, without structure, negligent and disrespectful!!"

A patient aged 2 hours and 20 minutes with a fever of 39 degrees and severe body pain. Soon after, the shift changed and then we were lucky enough to get a human doctor who had a different type of behavior (very different from the horse that treated us before). This doctor was quick, ordered imaging and blood tests and in less than an hour all the tests were ready and she quickly arranged for hospitalization as the patient was in sepsis. Thanks to this doctor, my friend was saved even though he had to stay in the ICU for 5 days and was very well taken care of there. If we hadn't been lucky enough to have changed the shift, my friend would certainly have died because the first doctor only prescribed dipyrone into the vein and didn't ask for an exam (an absurd negligence).

I went to the hospital on a Friday (05/04) already knowing that I had dengue (based on the symptoms). It took me 1h30 to just pass the screening (among these, the passwords called were not sequential, which is bizarre as it takes away the customer's sense of service). Soon after, it took me another 1 hour just to open the file (two attendants lost), apart from the disrespect they showed when they treated other patients who arrived later just because they said the waiting time (which was shorter than mine). Finally, almost 2 hours to be seen by the doctor to be sent just to do the snare test and collect blood. In other words, 4 hours in the hospital just to collect blood and do a test. They said that it would take 4 hours for the results to come out and that there was the option of having a telereassessment because then I could return home and return via WhatsApp.2. They got in touch scheduling the tele-reevaluation within 24 hours (ok until then). In this case, it was scheduled for Sunday, April 7th at 10:45 am.First of all, they called me before the scheduled time (Dr. Tamara). She received from me the symptoms she felt and the amount of water she was drinking, which was 4L as that was what the PA doctor indicated on 05/04. Another bizarre part - Dr Tamara says that this amount is not the ideal amount (doctors' knowledge is super aligned, right?). She asked me to return to the hospital and do the BP protocol (same as the one I did on April 5th) to take IV fluids and they would release it.3. Here I am at the hospital, the screening and registration were done in 30 minutes. Now I've been waiting for 2 hours to be called. They said that I need to see a doctor first before going into nursing. In other words, you have the reevaluation that tells you to take serum as soon as you arrive at the hospital, but in the hospital you have to go through an entire process.Horrible! If you can, go to OC or Hcor, which are closer and better."

I suffer from Labyrinthitis and had a terrible vertiginous crisis. The sensation was that my head was spinning a mile a minute, I couldn't keep my head up, with my eyes open, everything made me nauseous and the dizziness only increased. I started vomiting at 3pm and was waiting for my husband to arrive to see the doctor. It took a while and it was already dark when we arrived at the hospital, the triage technician gave me priority and sent me to the medication room to wait, but they forgot about me. I spent a long time asking for Dramamine, as I had no more content in my stomach to vomit and they said you need to go to the doctor and have her prescribe your medication. But, I said I suffer from Labyrinthitis and I'm in a crisis for God's sake and nothing! More time passed, I suffered from anxiety and despair hit me and I started screaming with compulsive cries: telling them that they had no heart, because they acted too cold. Then the technician told me if you cry you will become even more nervous and it will be of no use and more time passes.Finally the doctor appeared and said she would write the prescription and it would take more than half an hour to return with the prescription!!!  Guys, it felt like I wasn't in a hospital with a medical team. No one had the attitude of welcoming me until I received care. From there, my husband picked me up and announced that we were leaving. So, my indignant husband took me out of there and took me to the Edmundo Vasconcelos hospital, there I was given priority care and they put me on medication. Thanks to the team and the doctor on duty, who just by seeing me already informed me that it was a Labyrinthitis crisis. At Santa Catarina Hospital, I had good experiences when undergoing consultations, exams, surgery, but with this service at the PS, I never had to return again. I understand the demand that day, but nothing justifies the attitude of everyone on that shift!  I spoke about my young autistic son with my husband, completely unprepared to understand the context. It was one of the saddest days of my life, I have never felt so humiliated. I will go to Oswaldo Cruz, Edmundo Vasconcelos, BP, .... but Santa Catarina PS never again!!!"

It took a long time for the test results to come out, which is normal, but after the results were ready we spent a while longer waiting to be called back to the doctor.Last week, a neighbor commented that she took her young son to the children's emergency room there and spent more than an hour waiting for care.I've always heard that this is one of the best hospitals in São Paulo, but I confess that this first experience disappointed me.I was wondering if they made any arrangements for parking at the place, which is the most expensive I've ever seen in my life! After all, the longer a person stays inside, the more they pay for parking.

The rescheduling was done without prior consultation, as they schedule without knowing whether you can go or not.My son needs care and I am being treated as if I were in the SUS.Such disrespect towards me and my family, who is leaving another city for a consultation.Did I rearrange my entire schedule and was I informed about the change?"

She prescribed me an anti-inflammatory to take intravenously and again I questioned but can I take this when I'm pregnant, then the doctor told me but you have to tell me that you're pregnant, as I had already informed them during the screening and was mentioning all along that my obstetrician had oriented, he sent me for medication there and then another 1 hour of waiting they called me for medication and the nurses who were on duty were a mess and asked me to wait and everyone who arrived passed in front of me, on the third patient I asked why the others were passing by and I hadn't been called and listening to the conversation between them that everything was a mess, they had lost exam labels and they weren't able to make admissions that it would be impossible to get through the shift and all this in front of me and I didn't have an answer as to why They hadn't taken my medication, I was standing there in front of the nurses and they were talking to each other and they literally ignored me until I spoke and then I'm here, someone is going to take my medication, they put me in the chair and now at 6:55 pm no one has taken my medication and in the measuring room there are 5 people, all of whom already have access to the IV and I'm sitting without access and medication and 3 nurses in the small room in front of me talking, waiting to give a time to change the shift, what a horrible service, I understand that the nursing staff is super overworked but like this time it was clearly people's lack of preparation that made me have this bad impression"

It turns out that the structure and administration of the hospital is absurdly precarious. Poorly maintained hotels, extremely uncomfortable seats, dirty bathrooms and very few professionals on duty. I entered the PS at 7pm sharp and left at 11:30pm, that is, four and a half hours to go through 5 stages - screening, registration, consultation, medication and exams, and a new consultation, almost 1 hour for each stage. Almost 70 reais for parking! I was feeling a lot of pain, and the position of the chairs only made it worse, and they didn't even offer a stretcher so I could rest and wait for the pain to go away, or wait all these hours waiting for the doctor to return. It has always been a reference in the city of SP, I have received better service on other occasions, but the experience in January 2024 was terrible!"

The day I went to collect the kit to perform the exam, I already noticed the disorganization, several people were there and there was only one attendant carrying out the delivery, she was very patient, I confess, but it took longer than normal, mainly because it was done alone during business hours.  Today, 01/14/24, I went to take the exam. The hospital advised in every way that it was essential to arrive on time, and for what reason? For us to get there, after the exhaustive preparation that colonoscopy requires, and simply delay the exam by three hours. I don't think it's reasonable for them to delay so much. If you know that the exam is usually delayed, schedule time for this, do not make patients arrive after difficult fasting and preparation, and wait for an abnormal delay. Furthermore, a patient who was scheduled after me, because she arrived much earlier than the established time, was seen earlier. In other words, scheduling so that, you know, they are served on a first-come, first-served basis... I also had headaches and stomach aches before and couldn't take anything due to the absolute fasting required.  Simply disappointed."

When I get there, I wait in line for between 1 and 2 hours to be served. I went to the appointment, waited to take medication and then went for an abdominal ultrasound. It turns out that the waiting room for the ultrasound is PACKED. There was nowhere else to sit. It seems like they were at least 2 hours late, with several patients complaining about the situation. Scheduled patients who did not have their appointments respected.Since there were 8 exams in front of me and I had already spent almost 3 hours in the hospital, I said that I would prefer a doctor's order to perform the ultrasound tomorrow morning at a laboratory and leave because I need to work. The doctor, however, said that there was no point in providing me with a medical request as the ultrasound would be to rule out urgency and that was it. I don't know what it would cost for this person to make a medical request to me. It seems like he was asking for a huge favor. I won't go back to this emergency room"

All inflamed, in pain and short of breath. I arrived there on Sunday 5/11/2023 at 22:48 and was classified as priority due to my saturation being low. It is really classified as priority. I was seen and medicated at around 1:30am, I had more tests and was re-evaluated and released only at 5am. 6 hours of stay, super uncomfortable seats, super tired and in pain, my stay in this hospital was torture. This is because I was a patient with a yellow bracelet, priority. Everything took a long time, when I arrived at the x-ray the guy from the x-ray wasn't in the room with a note (I'm in the ICU and I'll be right back) and he took a while to show up, when I went for the ultrasound the girl from the ultrasound wasn't there either and took a while to show up. After the exams I went back to the 1st floor and they told me that I was.without.the system and the aedica was in the ICU and would take a while to show up. The system came back and again the nurses said that Aedica was downstairs attending to other patients. They told me that there was only one doctor to attend the emergency room and ICU. Imagine a doctor leaving the ICU to work in other sectors..... Terrible. My treatment itself wasn't complex, I just took 3 pills and an Aerolin pump and went home. This could be prescribed at the first consultation and I would buy it at the pharmacy and go... this hospital needs a lot of organization"

I refused to be discharged for fear of something serious happening at home (they tried twice) and now I have requested a transfer. Even with a few tests performed that came back normal, they don't want to do any more tests (??) That's because the insurance covers it.I'm horrified.I'm recording everything, because if something serious happens because of professionals who refuse to do their jobs, I'll put in place a beautiful process.Not belittling illnesses, but I'm not talking about viral symptoms or something simpler.

Unfortunately, in recent years my experience was with the high level of service at Sírio Libanes. Disappointed with the service at Santa Catarina.

Not to mention the delay.  We got there at 3:41 pm (password issuing time) and left at 10 pm. The physical space was poorly organized, I spent a lot of time standing with the baby on my lap, there weren't enough seats. Only 1 companion could enter, which made everything even more tiring. And my baby didn't get the care he needed.The screening, opening of the form and medical care were reasonably satisfactory, considering the capacity of the place. The doctor examined and requested x-ray, urine and blood tests. And he sent us to a waiting room to wait for the nursing team to carry out the exams.We spent more than an hour waiting to be called by nurses. When they finally called us, the nurse went to check the baby's veins. She saw that it would be very difficult, so she called a more experienced colleague for the procedure. The colleague looked at both arms and hands and put on a tourniquet. The baby was already crying a lot, as he was held for a long time lying on the stretcher, unable to move while being poked. Then he pierced baby. The blood didn't flow, it moved and moved the needle and it didn't work. He gave up and went to call another nurse. Again the baby was held, poked and poked. He didn't make it either. My son was crying a lot, he started to vomit from crying so much. Then they called a third person. He did the same procedures as the previous ones and was also unsuccessful. Then she turned to her colleague and said: “we will have to call the specialists in difficult veins”What do you mean they haven't called yet????? After the first mistake, they should have called a specialist professional, instead of torturing the baby with so many stings. I thought they were already experts, otherwise I wouldn't have even authorized all these bites. It took approximately 2 hours of torture. My son screamed in pain and fear. I didn't authorize any more stings.When we arrived he had a fever of 37.5. After all that fuss, I was already at 38.6.After that, he quickly took an x-ray and collected urine. Then it was another 2 hours of waiting at the laboratory. As the x-ray and urine were normal, the diagnosis was inconclusive, as a blood test was necessary to confirm the diagnosis.It took more than 6 hours in the hospital for my son's situation to not be resolved.The nursing team was inhumane, instead of assuming that they were not qualified to access a difficult vein, they remained there through trial and error.

The ICU doctors are excellent, they took great care of my daughter, always evaluating her vital signs.

Furthermore, my daughter was having a slight tremor, I informed the ICU doctor who promptly called a neurologist who also took very good care of her, carrying out tests to see if everything was ok and thank God the tests came back well.After they were sure she was out of danger, she was released from the ICU and went to her room, where she stayed for 2 days.I would like to congratulate and thank the care and love of the emergency room nurse who screened my daughter and took care to isolate a newborn, the emergency room doctor who was super attentive and all the doctors and physiotherapists at the ICU who were super affectionate and took very good care of my daughter, taking every concern for her well-being and the hospital is to be congratulated for its pediatric infrastructure."

Santa Catarina Hospital Paulista,"Av. Paulista, 200 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Alnete Do Nascimento,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 years ago,"Terrible service at the adult PS!I arrived at the hospital at midnight, with very high blood pressure (17/9), I had already measured it at home, with the hope of receiving intravenous treatment or medication faster so that the pressure would drop! I passed the screening, consulted with the doctor, they gave me medication orally, they took blood for tests, I had an electrocardiogram which showed nothing, and after 2 HOURS they came to check my blood pressure! They took 3 medications, orally, and nothing changed in the blood pressure… it was only around 6am that they gave me the last medication that made a difference!When I questioned whether I couldn't even take an IV drip, as I had been to the bathroom a lot, I was told that it would only be possible (as with any intravenous treatment) if I agreed to be hospitalized, an idea that they made a point of insisting on, given that I didn't have any other problem that would make hospitalization so necessary!Other people who were in the PS, receiving care through the health insurance, left much faster than me! I only managed to leave there when I said that I had only taken the money for an ER consultation and treatment, and not for hospitalization, in other words, it is a hospital that only treats you like a product (another family member, with care in the ER personally, went through the same situation), makes a point of putting you in situations that make you spend money, but the concern for the condition of the patient, who arrives at the ER looking for a quick solution, is 0%! Total lack of care and empathy on the part of the staff, and if you go privately, there is a high chance of being hospitalized with any excuse without feeling instead of receiving the appropriate and quick treatment that you should, so you can go and rest at home!I left there at 7:15 am with the conviction that it is a hospital where money matters more and professional ethics in dialogue with patients do not exist!"

Santa Catarina Hospital Paulista,"Av. Paulista, 200 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Leonardo Birche,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 years ago,"I caught Covid-19 in this hospital.I went to the hospital yesterday with pharyngitis, which I get quite often. During screening, they placed me with patients with Covid-19 in a cramped room full of patients. I spent more than an hour waiting in this room with people coughing and sneezing (and I just had the normal symptoms of my pharyngitis and no other symptoms of anything). I asked them to please put me in the queue at the general clinic, but they refused, saying that I should stay with patients with respiratory symptoms, even though I stated that I had taken a Covid-19 test hours before and that it was negative. Today, at 1 pm, I started to have a headache and weakness in my body, something I hadn't had on any of the other days. At 5pm I took a Covid test and it was positive. In other words, I went to the hospital with low immunity due to pharyngitis, I was placed with patients with Covid-19 for 1 hour (and I only didn't stay longer because I left without being seen) and there I caught Covid-19. I had never been to this hospital and now I know that I should have stayed that way. Lack of organization, respect and management."

I booked a rheumatology appointment 3 months in advance for 11/26, today I received an email communicating the appointment to 19-11, without even making contact to find out the patient's availability. I won't be able to on the 19th-11th, do you know what the earliest date is - the last week of December... I called to question and complain, the answer is standard, have a good day, if you want, it's like this... and they say that do philanthropy, it is better to close the doors to health plans and live on philanthropy and government subsidies only."
