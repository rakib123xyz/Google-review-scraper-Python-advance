Beneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo,"R. Maestro Cardim, 637 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Kelly Duarte,"Rated 5.0 out of 5,",a day ago,"Overall, the service is exemplary, but my praise goes to the receptionist Daniele, on the 8th floor, block 5.My mother is very weak due to cancer. I was attended to by Daniele, who went to my mother to take her identification to put on her wrist. Daniele played with her which made her laugh and joke too. The scene marked me.When leaving, we passed by reception and my mother also played with Daniele.Being in a hospital is never good, but the reception makes all the difference for the patient and their families.Thanks.Kelly Duarte"

From reception and screening to clinical care, we were treated very efficiently and cordially.I especially highlight the service provided by Dr. Jorge Paiter, who was extremely attentive, demonstrating high professionalism and empathy from the first moment. He patiently listened to my husband's complaints, explained the diagnosis clearly and in detail, and carefully guided the treatment. This stance brought us security and confidence in a time of concern.I congratulate Dr. Jorge and the entire hospital team for their excellent service, which reflects the commitment to humanized and quality care."

I've been waiting 4 hours to be seen. Everyone has already passed in front of me. Even those with a green ribbon. It's of no use...I found the screening to be very dryAnd I am preferential (TEA). That's a priority, right?I understand that when it's an emergency we don't go ahead, but everyone with the green ribbon has already left and I'm still here. Only 2 doctors treating about 20 people. And now they're gone... terrible!I'm almost leaving here and going to the SUS…. It's faster there.The other time I came I spent about 6 hours to be seenEdit: I spent 6h30 in the hospital!!!!The doctor who treated me is very good!!!But the general timekeeping is terrible"

There were 4 people besides me. Over time, I realized that no one was called. With that, I started marking time. Several people arrived, until the place filled up to the point where several people were standing because there were no more chairs available. 47 minutes later I heard the first call.5 hours later I'm still here after carrying out a total of 1 laboratory test and with no plans to leave.I don't recommend it to anyone and I won't return to this place again."
Beneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo,"R.

After hours of waiting, the need for hospitalization was informed, which only occurred at 2 am. During all this time, my mother had to wait in an old and unsanitary chair, until 4 am, in completely inadequate conditions.Furthermore, the care provided by a nursing technician was rude and hostile. When my mother asked about the room, which we are entitled to under the agreement, he responded in a disrespectful manner, which shows total disregard for the patient.To make matters worse, my mother has been waiting for a room for almost two days and, so far, has not been able to be transferred. She also did not have access to a bath during this period. The feeling is that we are in a real butcher's shop, such is the lack of preparation and disrespect towards others.If I had known about the chaos and terrible service provided by this hospital, I would have looked for a public hospital, where, at least, the service could be even more humanized."

However, I had two unpleasant experiences recently that I would like to report.I am 8 weeks pregnant and in the last few weeks I have had to have two obstetric ultrasounds. Unfortunately, on both occasions, I was treated with little empathy and a certain amount of ignorance by the professional responsible, which turned moments that should be happy and exciting into uncomfortable and stressful situations.I believe that situations like this do not match the standard of service that I have always found at BP. Therefore, I hope that this report can contribute to improving the service, especially in such significant moments for patients."

Beneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo,"R. Maestro Cardim, 637 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Aline Lemes da Silva,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 weeks ago,"The strategy developed by the hospital for emergency care could be reviewed. People go through screening, then open a form. They go to the doctor. As a rule, they will probably receive some medication and undergo some tests. So far, so good.After that, from what I understand, the patients' files all accumulate with the people who administer the medications and all go at once for reevaluation by another doctor. Not the one who received you and recommended medications or exams. But another doctor. Which is already counterproductive, in my opinion.And this way, everyone ends up spending practically the same amount of time in emergency care. The person who arrived, took medication and had an x-ray will stay the same time as the person who took the measurement and three or four more exams.I could be wrong but that was the observation I made today as a patient. If there is any justification for this procedure, which in my opinion is quite inefficient, I would like to know what it is."

Beneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo,"R. Maestro Cardim, 637 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Maria Cida,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",3 weeks ago,"One star is a lot for the exam withdrawal sector. On 11/12, I went to get the results of an MRI for my brother. On 10/30, I had already gone to take this exam, but even though I had called before and the sector employee, having said that I was within the deadline, when I got there, the employee Giovani, did not deliver the result, said that he was no longer in the exam. system, that I had to request it in writing and wait until 11/07 and that the employee who answered me on the phone was new and didn't know how to work. I didn't say anything. He had another exam to take, he said that at the end he would make the request. When he handed in the other exam, he pretended he forgot and I had to ask him to request it. I returned to my house. I live far away, in the metropolitan region. I had expenses, time and money. I return on the 12th, almost a week after the deadline, which was the 7th, I wait 35 minutes, several people pass in front of me and then an employee calls me and says that the exam was not in the system, it had not been requested, consequently, the department involved didn't send it, they were going to order it at that moment and I had to know that it would ""take a while"" (a little... 1 hour waiting). I went crazy, out of control, due to such negligence and incompetence on the part of those involved. Everyone in the sector confronted me, thinking my complaints were bad, another employee came from inside and stared at me. This Giovani said he was keen for me to complain to the management and even gave me his badge to show his name. I am 55 years old, I suffer from heart problems. What if I feel sick because I'm so nervous? Who will be responsible? And just like me, how many elderly and sick people go there and are poorly treated? What happened to this hospital, which WAS a reference? Today it is decadent. One employee worse than another. Lots of newbies. Uncompromising doctors. My family and I have been going to this hospital for years. From the beginning. Most of the doctors who worked and that we knew, have all left or are leaving. What remains? Doctors, nurses and employees with no experience, to take care of our health. If I were to count all the cases that have ever happened to me or to a family member or friend, I would type a book. And all this has been since 2022 and is only getting worse. It's very sad. An employee, who did not want to be identified, of course, said that complaints and grievances from patients are daily. In general. However, the exam withdrawal sector seems to want the trophy 🏆. I've also had horrible experiences at PS. But, I've also had great care, doctors, nurses, attendants, from the front desk, everything was impeccable. Only the memory remained 😢"

Excellent structure and always wonderful service, in all the sectors I have worked in, from all the employees and teams. Very good cleaning and structure.The snack is one of the best too.

If it weren't for the medical and nursing staff, I would give this hospital zero. What happened to the excellence of this hospital?Terrible cleaning service. We spent 1 and a half days without any cleaning, neither in the bathrooms nor in the room. And if the shower was after the pseudo-cleaning, we would stay in the water in the bathroom.The food was unbearable, and I'm the daughter of immigrants, used to eating everything. My husband spent the last 10 days eating absolutely nothing, apart from breakfast and afternoon coffee. And there were times when the water was gone!!!! Water!!!The laundry, not to mention. They often delayed bathing the patient because there was no linen available to change the patient's bed. As a companion, I needed to take mine from home.On election day, there was only one nurse to attend the entire floor. In fact, actually on Sundays, poor nurse who attended. He worked almost alone.It would be better to put up a sign so that no one needs hospital services on Sundays.Not to mention the delay in the arrival of medicines from the pharmacy.Now, phones are a separate thing. Try making an appointment at the membership section to find out what is terrible.Finally, there's a question. Is this poor service just for members, or is it specific to the hospital?Ana Maria Eivazian"

(Note that on that day, the system was constantly failing, which caused problems with patient calls from doctors and counters, not to mention the panels that started to shut down).I was waiting to be called from 8:32 am to the opening of the form and when it was 10:47 am, I was surprised by the delay, since I was already 47 minutes late for my appointment. I went to the counter to speak to the attendants and was attended by Ana Collino, who said that a problem had occurred and Dr. Sayonê would not be attending that day and that this doctor had only informed her at the last minute and that they were talking to her via message via (Whatsapp) and that the doctor Sayonê said that she would be sending 2 work colleagues to provide care to her patients, who were scheduled with her that day, this was what the attendant Ana Collino herself told me and the others patients and that's what I heard again, her talking to attendant Matheus, that the doctor would be sending these doctors to replace her and they asked me and the other patients to wait.We waited. until the attendant, Ana Collino, called us and took us to another location and said that Dr. Sayonê canceled her schedule and had not informed us anything in advance and that no doctor would replace her, that we would have to reschedule the appointment.In this regard, we complained about the negligence and lack of professional ethics of this doctor, since the other patients, including a lady who needed to change her complaint, had informed that it was not the first time, that this doctor canceled her appointments, that the situation It is recurrent and apparently Hospital Beneficência does not take any action.I want action taken against the doctor who cancels her appointments at the last minute and the attendants, who knew from the moment I arrived that this doctor wouldn't come and even so, they made me wait 2 hours there.I also want to be reimbursed for the cost of transportation I had, since my husband who brought me had to travel from our house in Barueri to BP and I'm not even going to charge for our time, which is more valuable and we lost due to the negligence of the doctor and everyone else.

Dr. Juliana was tireless in clarifying each doubt with patience, always with great attention and respect, both with me and my family. His professionalism and the way he accompanied me throughout the process gave us peace of mind and confidence, something fundamental in moments like this.The meticulous care taken with every detail of the surgery was remarkable. Dr. Juliana made a point of requesting the use of the nerve and vocal cord monitoring device, which guaranteed an even safer and more accurate procedure. Today, I can say that the surgery was an absolute success, not only because of the impeccable technique, but also because I didn't have any complications with my voice or any other post-operative aspect.The recovery has been excellent, and this is the result of Dr. Juliana's careful work and expertise. I would also like to thank your team, who treated me with so much care and attention during my hospitalization, always attentive to my needs and the well-being of my family. Everyone's commitment made all the difference, and for that, I am immensely grateful.I heartily recommend Dr. Juliana and her team, who, in addition to being highly qualified, demonstrated extraordinary humanity.Signature:Kelly PerezPatient"

Of the three visits to the PA this year, two of them as a patient and one as a companion, all were terrible in terms of waiting time: it took 5 hours waiting for care! Other people in the queue were waiting even longer, with no response from the service teams and medical staff.This last time it was no different, the office doors were left ajar and no patients entered; the waiting time between one person and another is 30 to 40 minutes, and there is no justification given. They said there were 4 professionals attending and the volume of patients was high, but only two professionals were seen attending, something very similar to other visits to this hospital this year.This time, the doctor had to move to another office because there were no basic materials to examine the ear and throat.In the queue, a lady with a priority bracelet gave up after waiting 3h30, and a young woman with pain in her intestine and kidney also gave up after waiting 1h, having already vomited in pain. The disrespect is absurd. And to improve, the medical prescription and certificate are being sent via an app, not printed, which makes access difficult, in this case my certificate was not sent and I have been waiting for hours for the hospital to forward it.I have the utmost respect for the infirmary teams, all health professionals in general, whether they are care workers or doctors, and working in the hospital for medical consultations is very interesting -- what happens here is terrible management of the Emergency Room service, lack of conditions for good qualified care with agility and respect for those who are sick, and if applicable, decent conditions for those who are working."

I filed a complaint with Gustavo at the Ombudsman's Office and to date I have not received a position on the case.The nurse (identified as Carla by the ward leader) attended to me without attention, forgot to loosen the tourniquet, pierced her arm wrong, and kept talking to her colleague about her dissatisfaction with days off and shifts. I've been a donor for 30 years and I've never seen a case of a donor not being ""careful"" when donating. The nurse didn't look at my face once.It went wrong. It hurt, it turned purple, it bled.I went out and called to complain. I asked to speak to the person responsible and spoke to Shirlei. She answered the phone with the phrase ""Do you have something very important that you can't help but share with me?"" It's strange. I found all the treatment given over the phone strange. . . until I said that I would like to hear from the Ombudsman. Then she changed her tone and tried to redo the service with professionalism. . . but it was already too late.I sent a message to the Ombudsman's Office and spoke to Gustavo on the 11th. He said he had already received the message about the problem with my service. I said my arm was hurting and he said I would receive an answer in 7 days.I didn't hear back until Saturday and I sent a photo of my purple arm on Saturday via WhatsApp. I had no response on Saturday, Sunday or Monday.On Tuesday 17/09 in the morning he wrote to me asking how my arm was doing. I sent another photo showing that it was still purple, but less so.He asked me to go to the hospital and said that the leadership was worried about my arm... really? They're worried about my arm and haven't made contact for a week? They could have called me between September 11th and 17th or they could have gone to my house if the concern was real.There are very good people at the hospital (like the reception and triage team), but I found the nurse responsible for the donation, the head of nursing and the Ombudsman to be indifferent and passive.I don't expect this as a donor, a situation where the hospital needs me and I am a volunteer.I also don't think about going back to the hospital in a situation where my life depends on them. They didn't seem concerned about people or their well-being.I encourage everyone to donate blood, but I suggest another bank. I have never had a lack of care problem like this in 30 years as a voluntary donor.DONATE BLOOD, BUT CHOOSE A PLACE THAT RESPECTS PEOPLE.EDITED ON 09/21.- Only after opening Reclame Aqui and evaluating it on Google did Mr. Antonio from the Ombudsman get in touch saying that he had legal support to defend the 7 days for a response. In an exhausting process, I was unable to make myself understood and gave up without any more patience.The photo is from 7 days after the donation.I complained to give BP a chance to recover from its poor service SO I CAN CONTINUE DONATING TO BP.Donating blood is an act of love.I hope BP understands that a hospital needs voluntary blood donations. To achieve this, the hospital needs to create conditions of well-being for voluntary donors. Hospital patients need this.Perhaps one option is to join a good blood bank that respects the donor.The voluntary donor donates out of love."

For your attention and cordiality. I had to stay in the hospital for 6 days. The rating I leave for the nursing and medical team is 3. Treating the patient cannot be the only focus of professional care. My nutrition concerns and existing illnesses were ignored and I went through a lot of trouble during my hospitalization. I became malnourished and dehydrated. I lost about 6 kg. But they didn't care. My heart began to show signs of decompensation that I was told were due to anxiety. They wanted to give me Rivotril, but I would have relaxed and slept with dehydration if I had taken it. This is very dangerous. I'm in the healthcare field. If he had been a lay person he probably would not have survived. And according to the ombudsman, my report is not included in the medical report. What are they trying to hide? Four times there was cardiac decompensation, after a lot of conversation, I was offered intravenous serum. How was anxiety treated with serum? After my slight recovery, I started eating and drinking water. And then I told the nursing team this. The person looked at my two visitors and said to them ""I convinced her to eat, you have to try, right"". It's the first time in a hospital complex that they mocked me for my health condition. Are you trying to make me nervous enough to take this to court? Before, I couldn't eat or drink water because I was having a very strong reflux that came out in the form of jets. All the nursing and medical professionals knew that I was eating very poorly due to this reflux problem. They just told me that I should make more effort to eat and drink water. How am I going to eat and drink water if I have severe reflux all the time, day and night? All the professionals told me to follow a protocol. But what protocol is this that doesn't even provide the basics for a person who is suffering from reflux and can't drink water, because everything they drink comes out with strong reflux? There is a danger of bronchoaspiration. What is this protocol that waits for the patient to become weak and then offers the serum after seeing them feeling unwell instead of taking preventive measures and maintaining the physical condition that the patient has had since the beginning?

Unfortunately, I got worse and had to seek help at BP's emergency room. Arriving there, I was seen by an “emergency” doctor who began to diagnose my anxiety. It was insensitive, zero empathy and super rude.  Thank God, other cardiologists found out about my case and I was hospitalized for investigation. INCLUDING this “emergency” doctor was EXTREMELY SUPERB and arrogant towards the cardiology team. I was admitted by Dr Ribas' team and that was the only good part, as the medical team was extremely professional and qualified.So I spent this week at an arrhythmologist and in fact, I have an arrhythmia. I have already started treatment.Today, 09/06/24, I went to do the exercise test requested by my doctor and the doctor who was performing the exercise test, DID NOT KNOW ME, DID NOT KNOW MY HISTORY, also started to induce my diagnosis for anxiety, saying that The beta blocker I'm taking has an anxiolytic effect and helps with anxiety symptoms. Hey???WHAT PROFESSIONALS ARE YOU HIRING? WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR IS THIS WHO DOESN’T BELIEVE THE PATIENT’S COMPLAINT?I showed up today to take the exam, ONLY, and not to hear his opinion on what he thinks or doesn't think. I'm already following up with my arrhythmologist, I already have my diagnosis and THANKS TO GOD and my doctor I got a diagnosis and was able to start treatment and control the arrhythmia. And thank the good Lord, IT IS NOT AND NEVER WAS ANXIETY AS THESE DOCTORS WANTED TO INDUCE.Detail: I'm a doctor, I'm a healthcare professional and they treated me like that. Now imagine how they treat lay people.DO NOT TRUST YOUR HEALTH IN THIS PLACE.I DO NOT RECOMMEND EMERGENCY AID OR THE DIAGNOSTIC MEDICINE PART."

The environment, which was already stressful due to the emergency, only got worse with the lack of communication and clarity. People were not attended to for 5 hours.

I asked again about giving me only dipyrone for the pain, she said she would give me a Tramal along with it, without much importance.I was treated and everything went well.Leaving the hospital it was almost 11pm.At the pharmacy I discovered that she didn't prescribe Tramal, just dipyrone. I'm already irritated.I woke up in the morning with pain, I took the dipyrone and nothing... After 3 hours I took another... No success with the pain.The next morning my glasses bothered me again... Because of the pressure I was putting on my face... I thought I'd better go back to BP to get the prescription, after all it hadn't been 12 hours since I left there and it was in the system that I had used more than one pain medication.To my surprise... I had to do the whole process again... I would need a new evaluation, due to the doctor's typographical error.In short, another 4 hours inside the hospital, and the triage girl was so cute and gave me an emergency classification due to everything that happened.I waited for the doctor to re-evaluate me, he clearly disagreed with the previous doctor's conduct, he needed to change all the medicines she gave me, he said that with a history of sensitive stomachs, this antibiotic is not recommended, as it would cause damage, he changed the pain medicine, removed it the anti-inflammatory and added 2 types of corticosteroids, via mouth and inhalation.He was very attentive and actually listened to me.I hope it gets better now.I would really like the doctor to pay me what I spent at the pharmacy, for medicines that were not useful to me.A very big disregard for the patient, as it was clear that she wasn't listening to what she was saying...

The worst of all was the ANESTHESIST, whose name I don't remember, I just I remember the strong smell of cigarettes. He performed general anesthesia, because the herniated discs I have did not indicate spinal anesthesia. When he injected the medication into my vein and asked me to take a deep breath, I stopped breathing, I couldn't speak or move. I only managed with a lot of effort to throw my right leg off the stretcher, the worst feeling of my life! I wanted to run away.... He started telling me that everything was fine... but it was horrible! Then I fell asleep and when I woke up there was no doctor on Dr Fábio's team, nor the anesthetist who smelled like cigarettes... there was only another anesthetist. What a great scare, what a lack of responsibility!Talking to another anesthesiologist, he told me that the medications were taken together, but the medication that stops breathing should only be given when the patient is sleeping.

A very friendly nurse tried to help me, looking for something new, but in the end I was back to square one and she asked me to wait in a room.I don't know what I have, I don't have a diagnosis, I'm just in pain and tired. It's ridiculous how a hospital with such a well-made structure has such a lack of respect for a patient.I write this because I refuse to accept that the health plan is charged for an exam that was never completed and properly reported.I filed a complaint with the ombudsman and I'm posting it here as an extra guarantee for them to respond."

We were seen by Dr. Swami Cervone de Oliveira (CRM 68705) who treated us completely badly throughout the consultation. He threw the prescription sheets in disgust and said loudly in front of the patient that he “was very relaxed”, being totally anti ethical and unprofessional (this applies to any profession, let alone a doctor). We asked for a referral from the Dr. to have the wound bandaged, since we were in the hospital (and paying privately, by the way) and he, treating us as if we were neglecting my uncle's health and asking for a favor, responded to us as if We wanted the hospital to take care of him, not ourselves. After, withstanding a lot of arrogance, we got the referral to do the dressing, we stood in the hallway and could hear the nurse, Tatiana Santos, who entered the room to do the dressing, complaining and repeating “Jesus Christ”, again as if we were neglecting our health him and asking for a favor. It is worth mentioning that my mother, discovering that her brother was in these conditions, cut his hair at home (as he refused to go out), bought new clothes and took him to the hospital, the way they treated us and on top of that hear A DOCTOR saying in a tone of ARROGANCE that the PATIENT was “WELL ALREADY.

I do not recommend this hospital for hospitalization and surgery. My minor daughters had adenoid surgery on June 14th at Hospital Beneficência Portuguesa, the surgery went without any problems, the problems started after the surgery. They put my eldest daughter in a room with a crib instead of a bed, a seven-year-old child had to stay in a cramped crib, they took food that even dogs don't eat and they left a bottle of water without glasses. After my second daughter's surgery, they wanted to put them in a separate room since they are sisters and there was no way to keep them both in separate rooms. Not to mention that my daughters had been fasting since 8:30 pm the day before and on the day of the surgery it was already 4 pm and my youngest daughter was still not eating as they were checking the issue of the separate room. It's absurd for a five-year-old and a seven-year-old to go so long without eating. I had to take my daughter out of the recovery area on my own and buy a snack for both of us to eat, as I hadn't eaten since four in the morning. I had a horrible day and a horrible experience with this hospital. In the end, they didn't change my daughters' room, they didn't put them together in the same room, I had to ask the doctor for discharge, otherwise I would leave on my own. Not to mention that when you arrive you go to pre-hospitalization where there is no place to store your things, I had to go up to the surgical center with backpacks and bags to accompany my daughters and there is the risk of contamination. Unlike other hospitals that accommodate you in rooms or infirmaries to store your things. The only good thing was the medical team, excellent professionals that I have nothing to say about."

Now in 2024, perhaps it is poor management or administrative changes, there is total disregard for patients! There are a lot of patients, but the triage and counter part was quick, the problem was the service, the emergency room itself. On the sign, it is written that there are 10 (TEN) OFFICES, the employees think that we are not paying attention, but you can clearly see that they see a patient (average of 10 minutes) and are IDLE for at least 30 minutes! They are very busy and the queue only gets longer! Several patients have already complained about the delay and just choose to ignore it. A lack of respect for patients, seriously, that doesn’t exist!! Everything is expensive, the consultation, the PS, health plan and they treat us that way. I arrived at the hospital at 2:30 pm and now it's 6:00 pm and they still haven't called me. Worst of all, there are patients who are giving up on emergency room appointments because they take too long. There are elderly people, there are people in wheelchairs, everyone waiting and nothing.

After about 30 minutes, this same attendant said that I should be redirected to another waiting area, as I was in the wrong place, I asked if the doctor had already called my password, she said no, as I was in the wrong place, and that the service The orthopedic clinic wasn’t there, I said I wouldn’t go to an orthopedist but rather a medical clinic, the rude attendant said “KNEE PAIN COMES TO AN ORTHOPEDIST, MA’AM!” in a rude and loud tone, I didn't even have time to respond, she continued talking about where I should go, I said that I wouldn't go, that my care was at a medical clinic, and again she interrupted me, until the doctor left the room and She asked me why I was being treated, I explained the symptoms and that I had already asked for a change in the triage, as the error was there, and I was only being sent to orthop as the next one for treatment was mine, kindly, the doctor asked for me to enter the room and that she would attend to me, and so it was done.There are certain errors that are intolerable, and this is one of them, if only the attendant had LISTENED, she would have known that the symptom described was an error on the part of one of her colleagues, and would have avoided further inconvenience. There is a lack of patient experience training for the team, I have seen situations of rudeness towards other people too, the attitude of some employees is regrettable."

I CHECKED IN AT 3:58 PM AND WE WERE RELEASED AT AROUND 10:00 PM. DUE TO THE DELAY IN SERVICE, I ASKED DR MARCELO PAIVA CURY, CRM 109026, HOW CALLS CONTROL WAS BEING DONE SINCE IT HAD ALREADY BEEN WAITING FOR 6 HOURS AND NOBODY CALLED MY DAUGHTER FOR RE-ASSESSMENT. THE MENTIONED DOCTOR JUST REPLYED THAT HE WAS TO WAIT FOR THE CALL, I INSISTED ALLEGING THE EXAGERATED WAITING TIME. AND HE RESPONDED RUSHLY TO WAIT. I SAID THAT MY DAUGHTER'S EXAM HAD BEEN READY FOR MORE THAN 2 HOURS AND NOBODY CALLED. DR MARCELO AT THAT MOMENT, IN FRONT OF ALL THE PARENTS WHO WERE IN THE WAITING ROOM, SPEAKED TO THE SECURITY GUY, POINTING TO ME ""CLEAN THE ENVIRONMENT HERE"", WANTING TO TELL THE SECURITY GUY TO GET ME OUT OF THERE. I ASKED IF HE WAS CALLING ME TRASH AND DEMANDED THAT HE RESPECTED ME. I ASKED FOR HIS NAME BUT HE TURNED HIS BACK TO ME AND WALKED TO THE SERVICE ROOM. IN ADDITION TO THE ILL EDUCATED BEHAVIOR OF THE DOCTOR, WHO WITHOUT ANY EMPATHY FOR THE TIME AND TIREDNESS OF THE LONG WAITING, I NOTICED THAT BP HAS ASSIGNED A VASCULAR SURGEON TO ATTEND THE CHILDREN'S PS, WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE, BECAUSE WE, PARENTS, BELIEVE WE ARE CARE FOR BY PEDIATRICIANS. MY DAUGHTER IS 12 YEARS OLD AND AT THE AGE OF 5 MONTHS SHE HAD A SKIN INJURY AND WAS HELPED AT BP AND FROM THEN ON, DUE TO THE EXCELLENT CARE, WHENEVER SHE NEEDED IT, SHE ONLY WAS AT THIS HOSPITAL, WHERE I HAD MY COMPLETE CONFIDENCE.

Yesterday 05/02, after a worsening of symptoms, with bleeding and abdominal pain, I was referred to the PS. Unfortunately, I chose the PS at the São Paulo unit.  I arrived at 6:50 pm The wait between screening and registration was over an hour. I received an emergency care bracelet. As we are experiencing a dengue and influenza epidemic, I knew we would have to wait. However, this wait was 3h20. Several non-urgent people passed by beforehand. There were more than 100 people for 4 doctors. When I was finally seen, the doctor wanted to give me medicine for which, and I had no symptoms, I didn't like the service.  I was in a lot of pain and had a rising fever. After this service, I waited to take the medication and do 2 tests, influenza and blood count. And amazingly, wait another 2 hours for the results and another medical appointment.After waiting, another doctor, very attentive, by the way, commented on the results of the blood count, saying that it was stable, platelets and leukocytes, etc. He printed the result and gave it to me. At the time I didn't even look at the paper, I just wanted to go home. It was already 2 am. Detail, they charged me R$115 for parking.Today, I had an appointment with my obstetrician, who asked for the CBC results. When I went to send the exam, I didn't have the blood count! Only liver function, hematocrit and h1n1. To assess the impact of dengue, she needed to know about platelets and leukocytes. I called BP and they said that no one from the São Paulo unit would answer them, and I would open a call that would take 48 business hours to respond and that there was no point in me going in person to get the exam, as it is the same procedure as opening a call. ..they even insinuated that the exam had not been carried out. Conclusion I spent 7 hours in the ER for nothing, because I'm going to have to go to another hospital today to get my blood count. I spent more than 2 hours on the phone trying to find this test, and nothing... I made a very polite call to make a complaint to the ombudsman and amazingly, they hung up on me. I consider this treatment to be violence.I do not believe that this complaint has a solution or repair, but I wanted to warn those who, like me, considered the Beneficência Portuguesa hospital to be a good hospital, to reconsider and make another choice, if they have the opportunity."

Guys, it's even difficult to describe everything she told me.

A girl had been there for more than 6 hours, she couldn't wait any longer, my mother reported that she went to ask the girls to take away her access, she couldn't wait any longer, and still had to hear: Look, if you come and talk like that I'm rude to me, I won't help you!

Service, waiting time is surreal, stressful for both consultation and examination and even worse for surgery.All the attendants don't have a minimum of empathy, a minimum of organization...The information provided is divergent.Employees do not have the minimum knowledge to provide the correct information...Elective surgery and when the patient is in the RPA room they go to request a room and then discover that there is NO room available, outside they keep saying that the patient is still in surgery but has already left surgery just to save time.Waiting time was over 18h...When I tried to complain I was not heard and I had to hear that I had to wait and the patient in the RPA room had been awake for 5 hours, impatient, hungry...And they did absolutely nothing.He has no empathy whatsoever, total inhumanity, no respect whatsoever for patients and companions who are already suffering psychologically.Delayed service.Private hospital, elective surgery and NO ROOM AVAILABLE....And to make matters even worse, after more than 5 hours in the RPA room, a room was made available after much effort and struggle, it still took another 2h30 to take the patient to the room as there was no TRANSPORTATION TEAM available.Surgery ended at 7:30 pm and he stayed in the RPA and went to the room only at 2:00 am (morning).Note: entered the CC at 12:30 pm, surgery scheduled for 1:00 pm.The surgery only started at 3:30 pm as the operating room was not yet ready.That's absurd.It wasn't just me, more than 10 people were waiting with the same problem.Bad logistics...I only regret a hospital of this size, a reference but not fulfilling it.Regrettable, a total DISREGARD towards the patient and companion.And the worst, an elective surgery scheduled more than 30 days agoThe surgery was only performed at this hospital because I trust the doctor."

Beneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo,"R. Maestro Cardim, 637 - Bela Vista, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Raphael Moreira,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",8 months ago,"Throughout my journey in search of professional opportunities, I came across an experience that powerfully illustrates the importance of humanization and compliance with processes in the corporate environment, especially during the selection process. Applying for a job at BP proved to be a remarkable experience, but for all the wrong reasons.From the first contact with the Recruitment and Selection department, the lack of care and consideration for candidates was evident. Communication was scarce and unclear, often leaving me in the dark about the status of the process and the next steps to be taken. Such disorganization not only generated frustration, but also cast doubt on the effectiveness and seriousness of the company as a whole.The lack of humanization became even more evident during the few moments I interacted with HR representatives. The analysts responsible for the process, Tácia Giaretta and Cristina Vieira, demonstrated an alarming disregard, relegating me to oblivion and treating my concerns with indifference. The absence of empathy and genuine interest in my application was disconcerting and disheartening, undermining any prospect of a positive professional relationship.Furthermore, when trying to remedy the situation and seek a solution to the problems faced, I came across an even more disconnected and uncommitted leadership. Coordinator Tatiane Cortez, although aware of the deficiencies in service and processes, appeared inert and had little interest in resolving the issue, leaving me at the mercy of the ineffectiveness and lack of professionalism of her analysts who permeated the HR department.Given this experience, it is impossible to ignore the harmful consequences of the lack of humanization and non-compliance with processes in the workplace. The negligence demonstrated by BP HR not only compromises the candidate experience, but also undermines the credibility and integrity of the organization as a whole. After all, how can we expect front-line employees to follow the company's guidelines and values ​​when those responsible for PEOPLE MANAGEMENT themselves fail to do so?Ultimately, my interaction with BP not only made it clear that it is not a suitable place to work, but also highlighted the urgency of a profound overhaul of the Recruitment and Selection approach to communication, humanization and process compliance. Only in this way will it be possible to build a truly inclusive, collaborative work environment oriented towards mutual success."

But the part that I must consider again is that there are excellent healthcare professionals in this place, both nurses and doctors, I was very well looked after by the teams.

Results are extremely difficult to achieve, the attendants are completely lost.  I called 5 times and each one told me different information.  They hang up on you when questioned and the tests take a long time to have the results published.  Not to mention that SAC, which should receive and welcome problems to be resolved, requests a 24-hour response time to respond to an incident.  In a hospital, the SAC should be completely different from a SAC at an appliance store, which looks for a hospital in need of care, often urgent, but above all, human. If I urgently need a test result, I often cannot wait 24 working hours for someone to analyze my request.

A person distributing tokens, without identification.You arrive and have to ask the people waiting if you need to get a form and where.Now there are several employees on their cell phones, straight-faced.

I got up and went to the room to check if there were nurses there and how to get there. wait, there wasn't. With that, I asked the receptionist, who was EXTREMELY RUDE, to call the nurse over the radio to go to the department and start the service.After 4 calls on the radio, the nurse from triage 2 responded and appeared, apologizing for the delay and saying that she was having trouble turning on the computer, which was a lie, as I myself had checked if there was anyone in the room and there wasn't.Passing by the reception, the receptionist only took my card and never asked for my photo ID. Which is absurd, as it could have been someone else using my insurance, but we continued the service with almost 40 minutes of entry.Arriving in the lilac sector, there was ONE doctor attending, Dr. Carla, so there were elderly people in front of me, after another 30 minutes I was seen and taken to the medication and exam room for dengue fever.Arriving there at 4:34 am (more than 1 hour and a half from arrival), wonderful nurse Maria de Lourdes noticed that I had a fever, took my temperature and verified that the medications prescribed by Dr. Carla had nothing for this symptom, so She went to the room and was received by Dr. Carlos, as they had changed shifts.Dr. Carlos then ordered me to stop taking the medications prescribed by Dr. Carla, and I had already taken 70%, as he said it was contraindicated for those with suspected dengue fever and replaced it with dipyrone.I finished the medications and spent another hour waiting for the test results to come out, then another 40 minutes waiting for Dr. Carlos to call for reevaluation. AN ABSURD! When looking at the results of the tests, the Dr. himself went to the laboratory, as he said that the tests did not ""match"". The results didn't make sense to him and so he asked me to take the tests again...Doctors do not trust doctors, doctors change medications prescribed by doctors themselves and doctors do not believe the results of their own laboratory tests.I went in at 3am and it was already 6am and I didn't know what I had, and to find out I would have to start all over again. In pain, hungry and paying for a service offered by a hospital with no organization and with totally unprepared professionals.I give it a 1 because I can't give it a 0! TERRIBLE from beginning to end!"

My 70-year-old mother arrived super tight to go to the bathroom and couldn't get through the turnstile to access a toilet until she got an ID.After getting her identification and queuing with her documentation, we received a map to get to the sector. I arrived in front of the office where there were approximately 5 to 8 armchairs and sat down... I stayed there for approximately 15 minutes when I read in small letters that before being called to the office I should go to a counter located in a room behind the place in that we were.When I got there I was waiting for a few minutes when the doctor came to speak to the receptionist and he said that we were there waiting to register.We were reprimanded as if we had arrived late for the appointment, something super unpleasant for those who arrived 23 minutes before the appointment and due to a lack of kindness and information we went through such embarrassment.The situation was worse after the consultation.My mother needed to go to the bathroom again just like me. Soon after, we went downstairs and I went to validate the parking which, according to the girl, for 5 minutes I paid for another full hour totaling 55.00.When I finished paying, I remembered that I needed a time statement for my work, I left my 70-year-old mother sitting and went to the entrance counter to make that request where I needed to queue again. When I was attended to, I was advised to return to the sector, but the place on the 3rd floor was already closed. I was advised to go to the hospital, which also couldn't give me a statement about the length of my stay accompanying my mother to the consultation. I was even ridiculed because Adriano, the attendant, maintained the stance that only Mr. Jorge could resolve the issue and that he should already be in his home 🏠.It is truly unacceptable for a person to be inside a hospital 🏥 with registration and entry tag, scheduled medical appointment and not be able to obtain a declaration of their attendance to accompany the 70-year-old mother who recently suffered a HEMORRHAGIC CVA in an appointment with the geriatrician.In other words, after working until 4:30 pm I will have one day off, losing my pay, because at HOSPITAL BENEFICÊNCIA PORTUGUESA, even though you are inside the hospital 🏥 with the patient, just because the department closed while we were in the bathroom at 8:30 pm at night, there is no more no one else capable or qualified to issue a time statement."

They didn't relate to what she was saying, wanting help for the pain I've been feeling for days, she then replied “I'm not asking, I'm stating”. Towards the end of the consultation, when I asked her a question and she was again harsh, I told her that I wasn't comfortable with that, and she said she was speaking sweetly and that she understood that I was stressed because of the pain, but in that At that moment I wasn't even in pain anymore since I had been medicated and I didn't even have the strength to be stressed because I was feeling so weak. I gave up explaining because I realized she wouldn't understand.I was stressed when at 4 am, to go to the hospital I was told that I would be on a stretcher waiting 24 hours for a room or that I should count on luck, in the words of the nurses, to get one sooner.I wouldn't mind waiting, but 24 hours or luck???? I pay more for a medical plan with an apartment because being in a hospital is very uncomfortable, thinking about that I just wanted to rest after spending almost 10 hours doing a lot of tests and not knowing what I had.When I said I was going home, they made me sign a waiver stating that I was aware of the consequences that the doctor had given me, but no doctor came to talk to me about my case or give me guidance since I wanted to go home. rest. I continue to have the same symptoms, without being able to eat or drink water... despite having signed the form, I know that I need medical care and I would really like to have received it, but I'm not going to “count on luck” in a hospital of this size"

In any case, they took great care of our boy, from start to finish. The nurse let me stay with him, and even though he was so bedridden, he laughed at her jokes, the doctor talked to us and even got emotional. Everyone was doing everything for him. And this makes us so calm, because we know we did everything possible, but when God has a plan there is nothing we can do.

The attendant said no, that she would only need to send the aforementioned documents to the hospital's email address and the exam schedule would be confirmed.On the same day, I sent my document with photo, health insurance card and medical request. I then received a message confirming the exam schedule for 6 Jan 24, at 8:45 am.On Friday, I asked via email from the hospital if I would need an authorization guide to carry out the exam the next day, as I had been told by friends at work, but I was given no guidance.I woke up at 5:30 am on Saturday and went to the location an hour before to take the exam, and after waiting 30 minutes I was seen, and to my surprise, I needed such an authorization form from my health plan to be able to take the exam, if Otherwise, the private value would be discounted.Now, why didn't they tell me this before? Was that the intention, to make me show up at the location and take the exam anyway?I wasted my time and money traveling only to find out that I could not take the requested exam with the documents presented, even though I had already sent the documents and asked about the guide via email previously.I know that as a patient I have no obligation to know about the hospital's procedures, so I asked about it. If I was given the wrong advice, the loss should have been the hospital's and not mine.In the uncertainty of being able to obtain the authorization form from my health plan, I stopped taking the exam and now only God knows when I will be able to schedule an appointment at another hospital.Unfortunately for me now, this Hospital Beneficência Portuguesa only has a name and appearance."

From requesting a parrot to urinate to transferring to a room, ward or apartment.The hospital is gigantic and the only thing that works is the ICU, the rest looks like a bunch of dizzy cockroaches fighting each other, the staff don't even understand each other, everyone says something different.A warning if you choose to pay for the change of accommodation, I warn you that they sell without having accommodation available, but for charging in advance they are excellent, so be prepared for stress, headaches, neglect of service.Parking is absurd, 120 reais at 12pm....

Space in the children's PS was tight, more than 1 hour, even though my son was next, he was not called. We left without care because it was easier to catch a disease there than to treat what he had. This is because I only go to the ER when directed by his pediatrician. Very attentive receptionists, there are drawings and chalk for children to entertain themselves, but whoever shouts the loudest gets service there. My son was next, a father complained to the security guard, he passed his 2 children in front. So I don't recommend it.Ah, I forgot, as we were at the same reception as the adult PS, there are two cases that I thought were badLady accompanied by her children. She is in a wheelchair, apparently undergoing chemotherapy. Visibly more fragile, there was no face-to-face care, no care. He waited as long as others, if his children hadn't complained, they wouldn't even have called during the screening.Woman arrives with man in wheelchair, she crying saying that her husband was apparently having a heart attack.

Extremely time-consuming for screening, registration and medical care. That last one, by the way, is frustrating! They call children by their first name only. They called my daughter's name and another child came in, the doctor didn't bother to check the child's name! As a result, I spent an extra 1:30 hours waiting for care because the doctor didn't check the name of the patient she was going to see. Terrible. That was today, 06/27/23. If you have the courage to go to this ER, ask the doctor to tell you the child's full name to avoid situations like this."

Terrible experience. 06/19/23 ER crowded and a patient was visibly about to faint at the door of the medication room, with staff coming in and out and no one was touched by her appearance. (zero humanization). I asked the administrative attendant MARCELA for help, who answered me sharply: ""If you're feeling unwell, go in there and talk to the nurse."" (zero reception and zero education). That's what I did: I went into the room, spoke to the nurse but he didn't pay attention either. (humanization and zero reception). I went to the girl who was feeling ill, offered help and sat her down in a chair. I stood and watched the movement in the medication room and no one came to help the girl. After about 15 minutes she was called and I informed her that she was without a companion and that she was unable to stand.  They brought a wheelchair and the girl passed out on her way to the emergency room. I went to complain to Marcela, she shouted at me in the 2 flow A waiting room, saying that it was not her role to provide reception as she was merely an administrative person and had this guidance from her two medical bosses to whom I could complain directly. I argued that I did not request technical assistance, but rather someone to contact someone to confirm whether the girl needed prioritized assistance and she, in addition to being rude, outsourced the service for me to do. She continued screaming wildly at me, without any emotional control. It's incredible how there is an immense value in what BP publishes about QUALITY AND CERTIFICATIONS and the harsh reality. People unqualified and unprepared for this important activity that is performed mechanically, ignoring human beings. Amazingly, even in the face of the scandal, no one from management showed up to see what was happening. Literally ""house without an owner"".  I remain in the PS accompanying my family member, also in a wheelchair, and no one gives me any satisfaction. Regrettable06/19/23 - 9:58pm"

I had a terrible experience with medical care.The service at reception and screening were super fast, I was very satisfied with the agility. However, upon entering the room of the doctor who goes by the name of Dr. Ana Cecília (clinician), she asked what I was feeling. I was having a lot of pain in my back, stitches in my right breast, tingling, and extreme sensitivity in both parts, I couldn't even put on a bra. The doctor pressed the area and immediately diagnosed me with muscle pain. I told her that it wasn't muscle pain, I knew very well the pain I was feeling. On a scale of 0 to 10, I was in pain as an 8.I asked if we could do an exam for a better diagnosis. She refused me. I asked for an x-ray and said it wasn't necessary since I didn't have any broken bones, otherwise I wouldn't be lifting my arm in pain. Well, from my layman's knowledge, an x-ray doesn't just check for broken bones, pneumonia is also detected through an x-ray exam, for example. Anyway, I insisted on a blood test and again I was denied. He prescribed me an anti-inflammatory and a muscle relaxant.I didn't leave my house on a Saturday night to be diagnosed with just a squeeze on my back. The pain was tremendous. I left the room frustrated, my indignation is that I didn't ask to see another doctor, because I believe it's very easy to be a doctor like that. Stay tuned guys, ask for tests and not assumptions. I still bought the medicines prescribed by her, I only spent money. Because it wasn't muscle pain. But I took it to see if it relieved the pain and it didn't help! The next day, with even more pain and more sensitivity and stitches in my breast, I went to another adult PS hospital! During the screening, they took me to do an emergency electrocardiogram, while I left my ID and insurance card with the receptionist, I did the electrocardiogram, the doctor promptly examined me with patience and care, analyzed my skin and symptoms (she didn't even do that) , I did an x-ray and blood tests to give an accurate diagnosis as he said. And finally, I was diagnosed with Herpes zoster. In other words, if I hadn't returned to the ER in another hospital, I would have been in agony with pain. I was medicated with Tramal, serum and two other medications that I don't remember the name of now! I remained under observation and was discharged with a prescription for antiviral treatment and pain medication. And if the pain persists, I must return to see the infectious disease specialist! Quite a difference from the service I received at BP. I was extremely disappointed.I gave two stars because the reception was quick to open the form, waiting time and screening as well. The hospital is very well signposted.Stay tuned guys and ask for tests so you don't go home with pain and nothing resolved. I don't think anyone goes to the hospital to go for a walk and waste time, especially on a Saturday night when I could have been doing something else, I only really went because I was in a lot of pain.

They told me that I would be admitted immediately but it would take about 30 hours to get to the room.I spent those 30 hours in a ward with the air conditioning turned on full blast, which I don't understand as it shouldn't be good for anyone's health.Finally, they said that I would go to the temporary room and then to the permanent room and I asked more than 2 times to speak to the hospital because I am willing to pay the difference. But no one came to talk to me.I have dengue and covid, very low platelets, isolated in a place that looks more like a closet than a room, with no window, no fridge to cool water. There is no table for me to put my luggage on. The dining table sideboard is broken. the device that hangs the IVs has filthy feet. I'm here with a dirty bathroom shared with more than 20 people and I don't even have the courage to take a shower. Hygiene is crucial for health!!! Worse still, I still have to measure my urine and this makes everything more difficult when using a dirty bathroom!This looks like sus, not a hospital covered by sulamerica!Worse, I was admitted here 2 months ago for surgery and on every floor I went there were several free rooms. It doesn't make sense not to have a place for me to stay!my original bed that I paid for Sulamerica is for 2 people, not a ward with 30 people!!!I spoke to Simone from bp on the phone and she was very kind, calmed me down and said that I am a priority, but I don't think you are doing enough. In my condition, my whole body hurts, itches, I'm sick and lying on a hard stretcher seems like something the worst hospitals in the SUS do to patients. I'm sure there are excellent hospitals out there that give the patient more dignity.this is inhumane and cruel.Ah, I wanted to complain about the nursing team in the first ward I stayed in. I counted more than 2 liters of urine and they only recorded 1.4, which meant that my doctor did not release part of the serum into the vein. yet another cruelty.It's 9:40 pm and I still haven't received my dinner. not even 2 medicines!!!!Furthermore, I only have praise for the patience and politeness of many employees, especially my doctor and Gabriela at the hospital.If BP has such a huge demand it should be better managed!"

Beneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo,"R.

When I went to the room, I needed help several times and the night nurses were super helpful. However, around 8am, my access dropped and was grating on the floor and I called the nurse, who called the room asking what I wanted and I said I lost my access and she told me to wait. I called again after a while and nothing, then 2 hours later my doctor called me and I told him and finally the nurse came to help. He said he sent photos of the access to the hospital board. She wanted to connect the same bags to my arm but I didn't let her, because the access was scraping the floor and only God knows how dirty it is, so she changed them when I complained. I spent 2 hours without serum, without medication and had just undergone surgery.As I walked around the floor to move, I noticed that the access support had defective wheels, so I asked for them to be replaced and they did nothing.Furthermore, I paid extra to stay in individual accommodation, my 82-year-old mother stayed with me and they didn't even give us the option of paying for a separate meal for her, which is absurd.In the room there was no list of extensions for reception, nutrition, etc. so I didn't even have a phone to complain. everything went through the nurses and nurses and they clearly filtered my requests.Finally, when I was discharged, we asked someone for help to get our bags and we waited for more than an hour until someone arrived. I had to use one of my legs to lift my suitcase off the sofa, I made my mother with mobility problems push my suitcase and she left there in a very bad mood and I don't judge her. A nurse accompanied us and we told her everything that happened, but I think it still shouldn't have been passed on.Here is my indignation with the service and with most of the nurses on the floor where I stayed.I hope the service improves substantially. It's absurd that they invested so much in facilities and the service is bad."

I waited a little longer than usual, but so far, so good. I was very well looked after by the doctor and the nurse who administered the medication to me. My shock was another nurse openly commenting on how he thought a patient was ""pretty"", how he was attracted to her. I had no idea that healthcare professionals, working in the field, assessed how attractive their patients were and how they could feel so comfortable publicly expressing their opinions about it without any shame. Apart from the other comments I heard, which I prefer not to say here. How can a patient enter into peace, in a consultation, or in an operating room, with such a health ""professional""? Totally unethical."

The hospital pharmacy doesn't have medicine, my son didn't take any medicine, the only thing they had was dipyrone, that bitter and bad thing that even us adults struggle to take.

Well, it started with the service at the PS, which was quick and objective. The doctor admitted us on Saturday night to do the exam. It was done early on Sunday morning, quickly.But hence the reason I posted this message:Guys, the quality of service was far, far above normal.

Fantastic! She held my wife's hand during the exam. It was too much. It was wonderful. The team was not only perfect, they went above and beyond what was required and did so well that she was able to undergo the exam without anesthesia.So the doctor came by on Saturday afternoon and asked for another session, the first was for the skull, he asked for a second for the spine and chest. In fact, the doctor was great too.Do you know what happened? The service was spectacular again! Now also with the presence of Daiane. Result: Did it without anesthesia again. Twice without anesthesia and that had never happened before.It was something very important in her life, which will have consequences from now on, because she will always have to take this exam.

Initially they sent ice cream and Danone, with egg and milk in the composition, then the nutritionist came down to the room and asked to suspend it (later that I ate it!) but practically EVERY day they sent me beaten chicken soup, I could even feel the lint in the chicken...I, unable to speak, immobilized, fragile and with several limitations, had no strength to fight for a diet compatible with my life. The worst thing is that they still said ""Vegan Patient"" on the packaging but the inside was PURE CHICKEN.This is unacceptable. The hospital's medical and nursing staff are to be congratulated, but the nutrition team proved to be absolutely incompetent.If you are reading this and are thinking about having surgery and have any dietary restrictions, think carefully before choosing this hospital. What if I was allergic and had a bad time after surgery? BP's only response was ""we are sorry that happened"".

I would be in a medication chair and my companion would be in the chair, without a shower, without resting before surgery, I was offered a diet in the middle of all those people waiting to be seen and who were coughing, sneezing, and there were probably people with Covid.Stretchers with bedridden people, with medication, intubated, and with some type of monitoring were exposed to the public waiting for their turn there in the Subsoil 1 region, close to elevator 25. Very sad and with no privacy apart from the risk and exposure to contamination in that area, as there were people working in dirty clothes (clothes of a mechanic who injured his hand and had been waiting, poor thing, since 11:30 in the morning) and mixed with everything and everyone there. The Nurse who took my collection tied my arm with an elastic to make a tourniquet that hurt, and at no point sterilized her hand, she took the latex glove straight from the box inside a drawer of those support carts and the drawer was dirty with dust and debris of paper you could see.  The disorganization was clear and how the nurses and technicians were lost in the process, literally “banging their heads”. We went to complain to the hospitalization leader about the fact that there was no bed available and he told us that the deadline was 24 hours, and we were very lucky because there were already patients waiting for 48 hours (and he spoke as if that were acceptable, absurd, Mr Wesley !!!) .At that moment I asked for the cancellation of my hospitalization and the procedure and I saw that I wasn't the first, more than 20 people had already done the same, 3 families were trying to get an explanation from the same attendant and they were excited. A nurse even confirmed the chaos saying that they didn't even have clothes for the patient anymore!  This is regrettable, Administrators of such a renowned Hospital!Apart from the ABSURD price of parking inside, R$224.00 per day!!

When one finishes coughing, the other starts.What do they want?Proliferate everyone's viruses?When I asked to be able to wait on the ground floor, the employee said that it was not recommended as I would have to wait in this ridiculous space, it is small, there was no place to sit, and after 4 hours there were some empty seats.I went to ask how much I still had in front of me…. 13 people still!!!Can you believe it?The best way is to leave and realize that I lost more than 4 hours of my life with the risk of contracting any disease other than the one I have symptoms of."

If you have to fast, count on waiting two hours! The last terror I experienced at BP was on 18/05, I made an appointment with a doctor, it took me 2 months to get an appointment because I wanted to be seen by doctor M, however, the one who saw me was doctor B, look, I reiterated that I waited two months to be seen by doctor M! At reception the attendant said, everything is fine!To make matters worse, I had a routine exam that I've been doing for over 40 years, but this time the pain I felt was enormous! I informed the doctor's assistant and she said it was normal! Like this? The exam I took, BP informed me that if I wanted to have the result that it was my right, I would have to call FLEURY and wait for it to be sent via email, they didn't even give me a protocol for the delivery of the material!Bad experience!I intend to look for other accredited providers even if I don't have the convenience of having a consultation and exam in the same place! The service from the employees is excellent, in general from the medical team as well, except for those who put the status of doctor above the why and for what and who chose the profession of serving PEOPLE.They put themselves in the posture of superior Gods, the doctors, lol!

Then it took me another 1 hour to go to the appointment with the general practitioner and what surprised me most, another 1 hour waiting standing in front of the medication room to get an injection. Now, I don't judge the nurses or the staff working there because they were clearly understaffed and overworked and yet they were attentive to me. But I feel that in this particular hospital there is a lot of bureaucracy, the processes don't seem to be optimized or streamlined, everything is slow, the doctors spend more time filling out paperwork on the computer than assisting us and the same thing seems to happen at reception. In the medication room, there were few people to assist and a lot of people arriving, a bit of disorganization because some people arrived in a worse state and ended up passing in front of them. I think it would be extremely important for the Hospital to seriously look for a way to optimize its processes and reduce bureaucracy because I intend to change Hospitals after this situation."

I left the city of Mongaguá, in my brother's car, paying the toll and fuel for the trip and back, I spent TWO HOURS inside a screen with a plastic curtain, without anyone taking any action to assist me. I went up to the ground floor, announced that I was leaving due to lack of service, provided the necessary clarifications and outside I was still charged with a HUGE charge of 96.00 (NINETY-SIX REAIS) for two hours of parking, and I returned home much worse off than before. than when I entered the hospital. One of the emails they sent me (the second) charging 289.00 reais, had in red letters the threat of legal action if there was no payment. Payment for what?negligence in service, lack of responsibility, lack of professionalism? I hope that the management of this institution becomes aware of what happened, checks whether there is a medical record, what the medical diagnosis of my health problem was, what medication was given to me, what exam I underwent, what was the prescription that the doctor gave me... etc.  You will realize that THIS INFORMATION DOES NOT EXIST, simply because THERE WAS NO SERVICE.  If they still insist on continuing to harass me, there will only be the path of justice, and there I will claim compensation for MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE, UNDUE CHARGES, EMBRACEMENT AND MORAL HARASSMENT. Finally, search for my name and documents, how many times I have been to this hospital and whether I have ever stopped paying for my appointments.
