Hospital Santa Paula,"Av. Santo Amaro, 2468 - Brooklin, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Nanci Rocha Alexandre,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",14 hours ago,"I have a surgical procedure authorized by the Amil insurance plan, but the hospital refuses me care!!!! I try to contact by phone, the calls simply don't go through, I try on WhatsApp and the attendant refuses to continue with the transaction. Total disregard for the patient. Looking at the reviews, I believe that this is exactly what you offer.Zero respect for the patient!!!Bad service"
Hospital Santa Paula,"Av. Santo Amaro, 2468 - Brooklin, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Karoline Ribeiro,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 days ago,"1 star because there is no option for any.I entered the hospital at 5pm after breaking two fingers. 1 hour to wait for the doctor who didn't even look at my face and asked why I hadn't come sooner. The doctor ordered an RX which I waited 1 hour for and when I went to complain the order hadn't gone to him. As I broke both fingers, the doctor requested bandages. After that, at 7pm the shift ended. I spent 1:30 waiting for the person who was late to immobilize my finger. That he behaved badly. All of this paying 900 reais for an emergency that has no right to return. If you have a choice or can afford it, choose another PS."
Hospital Santa Paula,"Av. Santo Amaro, 2468 - Brooklin, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Elisete Costa,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 days ago,"I put one star because there is no way to put ZERO!Terrible service, I had surgery at this hospital, thank God my doctor is good, but the hospital is worse than the SUS, NURSING is TERRIBLE, everything you might need within this hospital in any area takes a long time.Hospital has people who pass on information about hospitalized patients and we receive scam calls.TERRIBLE!!!!!"
Hospital Santa Paula,"Av. Santo Amaro, 2468 - Brooklin, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Denise Porto,"Rated 2.0 out of 5,",5 days ago,"It's been terrible, 1 hour wait in the emergency room which is empty at 2:28 in the morning. I was shocked when I entered, the facilities, which were once good, now look abandoned. Poorly maintained floors and furniture, disgusting PS bathrooms, smelling very bad.It takes time to call to complete the form and instead of being quick, they asked me for registration information such as updating my profession, something that has no impact on my service.I had to sign 4 different digital documents. Zero agility in all aspects. The service at this hospital has gotten much worse."
Hospital Santa Paula,"Av. Santo Amaro, 2468 - Brooklin, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Natasha Marques dos Santos,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",5 days ago,"First and last time at this location.Extremely unprepared staff, from reception, who didn't know how to open a file, to nursing, including the medical team.Nursing technician Marcos came to puncture me without performing hand asepsis, antisepsis of the puncture site, I asked for hygiene of the area, he went to one place, ran his finger over it again and punctured, so I didn't understand why to do antisepsis if he was going to pass his ungloved hand over it again and after all this lack of preparation, he still missed the vein. I don't mind being repunctured, after all I'm also a nurse and I know that some veins are difficult, but I was incredulous at the lack of hygiene of the hands, the puncture site and the lack of use of glovesThe technique that came to puncture me soon after was a little more hygienic but using headphones, with personal clothes over the private one.The serum that arrived to be administered full of air, I went in with a concussion and was at risk of leaving with sepsis and embolism.Doctor working with his back to the patient, except that the test results came out and we had to go to his room and call him to let him know, after all he wasn't seeing anyone and didn't call for a return call.Being in the health sector and understanding all the processes how they work, I expected quality care from a private service, before I had gone to the SUS. Free and with the same level of service.I just don't give zero stars because unfortunately it's not possible."

In fact, I want the service itself to be 5 stars, but the parking valet leaves a LOT to be desired! When we leave the car, our experience begins, and we are often apprehensive (you agree that we are not in a hospital for a good thing, right?) and he, instead of being receptive, every time (it wasn't just once... .) it was very rude! And the same valet!  They should review how they treat customers!"

I saw that she went looking for the doctor and after 10 minutes of searching for him, she got his personal number, and he said he called me (a lie) and couldn't get in touch.

Mismatched information, delay in care... I had severe hypokalemia and they only treated me at the ER when I lay down on the floor because I couldn't stand to stay in the chair (even though I had already said that I couldn't stand sitting and that I had tingling in my hands and arms and felt arrhythmic). The team doesn't talk to each other, which made me seriously doubt the doctors' conduct and ask for discharge once I was stable. No one brought meals, even after asking repeatedly and fasting for more than 24 hours, I had to ask my companion to go buy cheese bread and juice. When the meals came, they were absolutely terrible. Companion was also with me for more than 12 hours in the hospital and even after being admitted to hospital he did not receive any comfort. In veterinary hospitals with smaller structures, we serve patients better than in this one. Run away"

My aunt was allocated a room where construction was in progress, the service was very slow and the staff seemed disoriented, unaware of what was happening. There were few employees and they seemed very unprepared, giving the impression that the hospital was on the verge of bankruptcy. Everywhere I looked, I noticed savings in some aspect, which was very noticeable.4 years ago, before the company DASA acquired the hospital, the situation was completely opposite. What the DASA group did to this hospital is heartbreaking. I don't recommend it to anyone; It's looking like a public health service, but at least it's free. It is regrettable to see the decline in the quality of service provided."

For neurological PS too. I hated the regular Ps, I went with a back allergy to soap and the doctor emphasized that it was syphilis, even though I had recent tests proving that I didn't have an STD, he insisted that I should do new tests, I didn't want to consider any other possibility.I went again with COVID (I found out because I left there for another hospital) and the doctor said it was just muscle pain in my back, she didn't want to take a COVID test and even gave me medication that I had already said I couldn't take! It was anti-inflammatory, I have an autoimmune disease, I informed them that I was prohibited from taking anti-inflammatory drugs and the person gave me sublingual toragesic! I left the hospital and looked for another hospital where I actually received decent care and COVID was confirmed.I saw the doctor Daniel Zamudio Igami, Gynecologist, from 2020 to 2021. I had endometriosis surgery with him in 2021, I had a lot of pain. He told me that I had 4 “little spots” of endometriosis, which did not justify my pain, some tiny external fibroids that also did not justify it, fibrosis, which according to him was an endometriosis scar and did not cause pain, tubal cyst. He performed a hysteroscopy and found diffuse adenomyosis, but he would never remove my uterus so as not to prevent me from being a mother, even though I had every justification that I would never have a child and that I wanted to be well. 2 weeks after the surgery I sent an email, suffering a lot, saying that there was something wrong with the surgery because I was having similar or worse pain than before the surgery and especially in my left leg and he never responded to me. I tried to schedule appointments, there were never dates and appointments he wouldn't authorize. When I returned 10 days after the surgery, he told me that I would take painkillers for the rest of my life and would have to continue taking allied therapies. This surgery ruined me! Well, 3 years later I met Dr Igor Chiminacio, BR's greatest specialist in endometriosis, he repaired me, removed not only the outbreaks, but also the entire root of the endometriosis that was still in my body, as current studies on endometriosis suggest that it must be removed en bloc and not foci or cauterization, it cleaned several fibrosis that YES! They caused me a lot of pain! It released my sciatic nerve which was completely trapped due to endometriosis, my bladder nerve which was also present, it removed my uterus full of adenomyosis, respecting my lack of desire to be pregnant and my health which was extremely weak, parametriums and also cleaned several adhesions that this surgery previous left. Result, I am cured of endometriosis and I will never need to take medication for this problem again. I was treated very well this last time, any extra symptoms I had the doctor promptly attended to me, made fittings, calls, whatever. I have been completely cured for 6 months! Daniel Igami was a disappointing doctor for me when trying to treat endometriosis. Finally I had the courage to expose what happened to me and to be alert to other women!"

(which, in a way, was already a return) and, in their evaluation, Dr. told him he could return home without any problems. We immediately went to another hospital, where he underwent the same tests in the emergency room, having the same results, but this time, he was rushed for intubation, as he was having great difficulty breathing. Total mockery. The doctor, when questioned days later, stated that he had not seen anything of such seriousness in the tests. Detail: 50% of the lung was compromised and oxygenation was very low. He had been unwell for almost 8 days (COVID, diagnosed in the hospital), after being told to take medication at home.In the other hospital, within 2 days of intubation, he left for observation almost 100%, and continued only taking anticoagulants.Hospital care has always been very good and fast, even during the pandemic.

I went in April/2024, and there was an outbreak of dengue, viruses and flu, it was expected that it would take a while to receive care. However, there were two attendants at the triage, 3 doctors serving the general public. When I arrived, the panel showed a wait of 1h30, and it took exactly 4h (standing, as there were not enough seats due to the number of people) for the service to be provided. In the end, no medication was taken for fear of waiting another 4 hours in line. And the service criteria is completely illogical and non-transparent. People are categorized by level of urgency and even though they are at the same level, the order of arrival criterion is not respected. You are sick or accompanying someone in the hospital and you have to be cordial because the staff are bad-tempered as they are poorly paid and treated like rubbish just like the patients.

I don't remember the name of the sweet nurse who asked me to return in 20 minutes as he was not yet in the room. I called again and they transferred me to the sector where people stay after surgery and an angel answered, a man, I ALSO DON'T REMEMBER THE NAME, but I'll find out and edit it here. He said ""he's here next to me, still sleeping from the anesthesia. You can drink some water and calm down, because everything went well"" Seriously.

Detail: I was only seen because I knocked on the doctor's door to ask what time I would be called, as I had already been in the hospital for more than 5 hours. It took more than 2 hours to see the doctor and, after the exam, more than 2 hours to get a diagnosis. I went there with 1 problem and left with several.Furthermore, the price of parking is absurd, and as there is a lot of delay in service, even with an agreement you end up spending a high amount if you park there (22 reais for the first hour and +11 reais every hour).It took me more than 5 hours to come out with a prescription for 1 medicine, without receiving any medication. During the early hours (00:00 to 6:00) it gets even worse, as they only leave 1 doctor.Those who use the private service pay at least 500 reais (the price is set by the hospital and can reach almost 2000 reais), which does not match the service provided.If I had read the complaints I wouldn't have gone and I don't recommend it.

It was 16 days of hospitalization until his death and during all these very difficult days for us, we just have to thank him for the attention and care possible in every information about his condition without return.Everyone from the semi-intensive ICU and palliative treatment teams, cleaning staff, everyone was very human and kind.It's impossible to forget the day the doctor had to tell us that he had nothing else to do, very professional and, at the same time, very attentive and delicate, which is not always easy to find today.During the 16 days, they understood and allowed us to visit her at more flexible times, which allowed us to be closer to her with as much privacy as possible. The host was also very attentive and careful when they called us to inform us about his death and during the necessary procedures afterwards.Therefore, we would like to express our gratitude to the teams that accompanied us at Hospital Santa Paula, confident that we made the right choice of the place where my mother would live her last days.Gratitude to everyone who helped us during this difficult time for our family.

Those whose names I don't remember (especially a nurse who attended to us in the early hours of 10/06 who was so loving), please forgive me, they are no less important in my gratitude, as I said to some of you, for For me, it is not simply a profession but rather a gift of caring for others.I couldn't spend 24 hours with my daughter in the 3 days she was there, but I'm sure that God chose all the people who took care of her correctly.Congratulations to the hospital, which recognizes its team and always values ​​the people who work there.I also mention the cleanliness of the hospital and the rooms, which are cleaned constantly.My daughter continues to recover very well. I am grateful for Dr. Manoel's assertive clarifications, which left us calm and confident as my daughter continued.I noticed that all medications, all procedures that were performed, were calmly explained to her, eye to eye, realizing whether she was understanding or not.Thank you all very much, may God bless you always."

As my mother is unable to move, I had to ask an assistant for help. The bathroom was impossible to use, it was around 8pm, due to the dirt and she improvised a bathroom in the ultrasound room.Unfortunately, we were there for 40 minutes and my mother was unable to urinate, so a catheter had to be inserted.It was almost 40 minutes waiting for a nurse, what happens in this hospital??? There are no nurses????Oh, just for information that bathroom was only cleaned around 2 am. Can you confirm in a hospital that you can't clean the bathroom????Finally, all the exams were ready, but the DR. Caio had already finished and the care was passed on to Dr Danilo.His diagnosis was a joke, ""She has nothing and the tests are normal.""She had very altered platelets, altered blood count, sodium, creatinine, protein c, magnesium, tgo, amylase, lipase and LDH.When I said that this was not possible because I had access to the results, he said he would give antibiotics because of the erysipelas.I asked again that how could a simple erysipelas, as he had said, change everything and how could I give my mother more medicine since everything she eats she vomits and she was not urinating? Then he says the icing on the cake ""I can't request hospitalization because I'm an emergency room doctor."" I've never heard that in my life and as the name suggests, emergency room has the power to request immediate hospitalization.He passed the case on to the doctors at the back, because she was there awaiting the results of the tests, and the doctor, in a simple clinical examination, asked for hospitalization.And the funniest thing is that Dr.'s ""nothing"" Danilo requested admission to the semi-intensive care unit.Now I've been in the hospital for more than 12 hours, sitting in a chair waiting for a bed, this is ABSURD!!!!In the end, when everyone"

Service at the PS takes a long time, however, if it is urgent they respond very quickly.I went to the PS with diarrhea for 5 days, unbearable abdominal pain and I kept going to the bathroom every 1 hour, everything I ate wasn't even half an hour and I was already in the bathroom, I went to the Santa Paula PS and if I wanted they asked for a test , they gave me buscopan in my veins and sent me home, well, it didn't help, I continued to have diarrhea, and this time I waited longer in the faith that it would get better, but it didn't, I spent 15 days with diarrhea until I went back to the ER, once again no They asked for no test and gave me medication in my veins and gave me medicine at home, I took it for 7 days and while I was taking it the diarrhea went away, when the medication ended it all came back again, in total there were 29 days with diarrhea, until I scheduled a gastro straight away because I could no longer stand being pierced and taking medication. And finally the gastro discovered that I was lactose intolerant and everything was resolved. It could have been much earlier, if the hospital had requested an examination.The second time I went to the ER feeling really sick, with nausea, weakness, numbness on the right side of my body and my blood pressure was 8.6, they didn't do anything at the ER, the doctor diagnosed me, said it could be something I ate??? ? And he only gave me some medicine for the nausea hahaha in the end I went home feeling really bad with the blood pressure the same way and I treated myself at home. This last time I went with my sister, she has a very cold, she went to the ER because her cough got worse and she has shortness of breath and a lot of back pain, did the doctor ask for a test? No, he just told her to drink honey lol and clean her nose, tomorrow we will try another hospital and give up on Santa Paula altogether, because the doctors are terrible, it seems like they are all abandoned interns.

After 40 minutes, and without such a prescription being made, I was informed that she had just passed the case on to Dr Carla Goncalves Dias.I looked for Dr Carla (whose treatment towards me was quite rude) and she, although she didn't have any patients, told me to wait and she would call me.Haven't called yet...Here I am…with my sick sister, in the ER for more than 3 hours and without effective care.I know that Santa Paula was an excellent hospital and I always recommended it to my followers. I don't know if it's related to its recent acquisition by another hospital group, but the service isn't even close to what it was.To those who read this report, I recommend that you look for another hospital; At some point the philosophy of patient focus and mission got lost…These were the foundations that enabled doctors to know what was expected of them... effective humanized patient care was understood and practiced by everyone.It is through the foundations that we know the construction and when they collapse, it is the beginning of the end.For the poorly treated patient or companion, there is no use in standardized responses; Validation of what is reported and reversal of the accelerated decline is necessary.Ps. The 2 stars I awarded refer to the flow controllers and the medication team, very kind and helpful professionals, but who can do little without the doctors doing their part.It is now 1:46 am, on 03/16/2023; They again gave my sister a pill, solemnly ignoring the fact that she keeps vomiting...What do doctors think?

But I'll report it here without any problems.I was hospitalized on 08/26 for surgery. Right at the first appointment (Reception – Admission) everything was explained to me calmly when opening the form, everything I signed was explained to me and sent by email (So calmly, I could then read what I signed, as we know the nervousness and tension pre-surgery that we ended up not paying attention to at all).Within a few minutes of opening the form, I was accompanied by the hotel staff to my room, where everything about the facilities and procedures was explained to me again (Just for information, I arrived 2 hours before my surgery, so with that I was able to plan for fasting and medication before surgery). Once in the room, after 1 hour, some nurses came to introduce themselves and inform me about the pre-surgery, there I was able to resolve my doubts and they were all resolved.After the last hour, it was time for surgery. A nurse came and took me to the Surgical Center, where I was able to talk to my surgeon and the anesthetist, who explained to me again the procedure they would adopt for that occasion. I was nervous, anxious, but very confident and certain that I was in an excellent hospital, with excellent professionals and state-of-the-art equipment. I had the surgery, which, thank God, went excellently well, I stayed in the ICU until my saturation stabilized and after that, I went to the room.I stayed throughout that day and the following day under observation in the room, accompanied by numerous nurses, who, whenever requested, arrived punctually in my room to help me. All medications were given at the right time, prescribed by my surgeon. After 24 hours I was discharged from my doctor and went home.Here is my special thanks to the entire team at Hospital Santa Paula. For their receptivity, attention and care, everyone was always very helpful and polite. As there were countless professionals, I was unable to remember their names, but here's a big hug to the entire Surgical Center team (Anesthetist, Nurses, Assistants, Technicians, Instrumentalists and others).To the Inpatient team (Physiotherapists, Nurses, Assistants and Technicians).To the Reception team (Receptionists and Hospitality).I loved my time at the hospital and, whenever necessary, I would go to Santa Paula again.A big hug.Att.,João Monte"

Unfortunately, completely horrible treatment, without respect, without humanity, few helpers are educated, some weren't born for this, we are completely left behind. Horrified by what happened, now they have to do it all over again for the colonoscopy exam, old age and go through this again.We ended up sleeping there, on Friday (20th) we had breakfast and a nurse came to accompany us to the exit, it was another lack of respect and politeness, she toasted our stay, my husband was carrying a heavy bag and the young woman could offer to carry it.We are two elderly people and we don't want to treat them like employees, but kindness would be nice.Now look for another hospital so that this tragedy doesn't happen again.Sorry about Santa Paula, it doesn't solve anything, which requires respect from everyone, seeing where the errors are and trying to fix them, there are many and some are very serious like this one that happened, elderly man 80 years old, without eating, without drinking for hours, staying for 5 hours and thirty minutes on a stretcher awaiting the will of others.Thank you for reading and apologizing"

True horror film. This was my experience:I brought my mother (89 years old on May 19, 2022) to emergency care through SAMU, she entered at 10:00 in the morning on Tuesday, April 26/22, she spent until 6:00 in a chair, without water, she was vomiting with blood, when I asked for action the excuse was that there was NO bed available and that the water fast would have to continue for tests, in fact they only took her to a room at 1:30 Wednesday morning, as he remained on the emergency stretcher from 6 pm onwards.After that, she ended up in the ICU, she was restrained, her entire arm was left with bruises. They made it difficult to make a simple visit or follow-up (status of the elderly), to obtain information about her condition from the medical team, who only attend during the brief moment when they visit the beds, in this case they were Amil doctors, it was a matter of luck, and this Amil's team, upon discharge, did not recommend recommending home care (peaceful is the obligation in the courts) since the best oxygenation varies greatly from 86 to 92 when they removed the oxygen, which at first they had said they would need to use at home, they started using diaper, bed bath, 12 medications throughout the day, liquid thickener, soft food, etc. and so on. So it came out worse than it came in.Anyway, I lived the worst moments of my life thanks to Santa Paula and the great AMIL that I have paid since 1993, around R$ 40,000.00 or so annually, since my mother was only admitted to Sírio in 2006, which was excellent, and now at Santa Paula. My husband and I never use the plan for hospitalization, only for routine exams, and my plan does not cover medical appointments."

Negligence in medication (they forgot an important medication during treatment due to a lack of communication between shift changes) and neglect in the patient's nutrition. The family must do their best to feed the patient so that he does not die from malnutrition. I think the hospital is negligent in hiring such young on-call staff with no experience or empathy to take care of the Neuro ICU. I asked the young woman how the patient was, she replied: It's just the way you see it... absurd. It's difficult to leave your relative in the hands of people like that. The most serious is the health neglect in the ICU. Nursing does what it wants, it does not follow basic safety protocols such as the use of appropriate gloves and masks. Scary!"

In addition to providing an excellent and humanized service, they are dedicated professionals in their field and deserve to be recognized:Nursing technician Vivian Juliano from the Neuro ICU who assisted me during a hospitalization for the second time. Thank you very much for all your work and dedication, your care made a difference during my recovery period.The hygiene professional Viviane, who attended to me the two times I was hospitalized, always had a smile on her face and was very polite. I consider that the times she went to carry out the terminal in my room were the times I received a visitor (I was alone for most of the hospital stay) a very human and dedicated person. Thank you for the words of comfort and for taking care of my recovery environment.The Sodexo professional Juscelino: a unique, dedicated and attentive person, always concerned with providing good service, on several occasions he went above and beyond his basic work, so that I could eat as Sodexo's nutrition left something to be desired. Thank you very much for your concern in providing good service and for being sensitive to patients' problems.And to the exceptional doctors who helped me and are still helping me, and I'm sure that without them and God I wouldn't be here to be able to thank. Dr Paulo Henrique Pires de Aguiar and his team Dr César, Dr Roger, Dr Raphael, Dr Alexandre and Dr Ícaro. Thank you very much for your dedication, care and attention. In addition to being exceptional doctors, you are incredible people.I have some criticisms that I ask you to consider:On the day of admission to the PS, I needed to take a medication called vancomycin, which must be administered intravenously and slowly. The nursing technician who was worried about how she would take her coffee break (as she mentioned to her colleague) let the medication run too quickly, causing an allergic process in me. This process left my face red, swollen and in hives. The doctor on duty at the PS was called but he did not prescribe any medication, I only received anti-allergy medication the next day when my wife arrived and questioned the floor nurse.Nutrition: it is absurd to ask so many questions about food restrictions and preferences and then always send dry bread or toast and margarine or jam as a snack. The hospital has fruit salad, snacks, cheese bread and none of that is offered. It seems they prefer to see the patient complaining. I made several requests to adjust my diet and even had to insist with the nutritionist about what I wanted to eat. They sent tough meat, plastic cutlery that breaks when cutting the chicken. Really regrettable. Food is an important part of the patient's recovery process and must be taken with attention and care, not a lack of tact with the patient.On September 25th, I had an incident in bed and an artery in my lower back ruptured. Thank God my doctor Dr Roger arrived quickly, as the nurse on duty was more desperate than me when she saw so much blood. The doctor asked for material for suturing and surprisingly, IT TOOK A LONG TIME for the team to bring the material, the doctor charged twice. They don't understand anything about urgency and stay in the pharmacy's bureaucratic process, instead of going straight to the pharmacy station, as it was an emergency, regrettable. This negligence can lead to a patient's death, but I don't think I need to point this out to healthcare professionals, right?I only gave compliments on Google, because I was really well attended to and I recommend the hospital, but I would like to pay attention to the criticisms given.Att. Fabio Corridoni"

I would like to praise the service in general, from admission to the day of discharge. But I would like to give special thanks to some employees who served my husband with professionalism and humanization, they are: the physiotherapist Carla Aletto, the nursing technicians Adilson, Yngrid and Kelma (from the 2nd floor), the nursing technicians Jefferson and Vivian from Neuro ICU. During his stay in the Neuro ICU (which ended up being longer than expected), he was assisted by nursing professionals Jefferson and Vivian who made all the difference in his recovery. I say this because for a conscious patient in the ICU, the emotional side is extremely shaken, the surgery was delicate and he should remain in zero decubitus most of the time. These two professionals were extremely attentive and dedicated to caring for my husband, which generated in us a feeling of affection and gratitude, because meeting the patient's needs is a nursing professional's responsibility, but when the work is done with love and with The dedication of these two professionals ensures that the patient's recovery is faster and more complete. When we come across angels in life, it is important to thank them, so that they know that they made and continue to make a difference in our lives. Please convey our praise and gratitude to them.Thank you to everyone: Jefferson, Vivian, Adilson, Yngrid, Kelma and Carla. God bless you always.Thaís and Fábio"

He left early from work on Friday and took the test until ok. After the test was done, they were advised that he would have to be at the hospital at 5:00 am, he was asked what the procedure time would be, no one knew, they informed us that we arrived at the time they requested and soon Reception said they couldn't have a companion, how can someone have surgery and not be accompanied? Since it was like that, why didn't they tell me beforehand, that I had to go back home because there was nowhere for me to stay and when the procedure was finished they would call and tell me to come and pick him up because he would be leaving on the same day, what do you mean? They think that people live next to the hospital, my husband fought and got me to go in with him, but I had to stay at the reception when he went up to the room, because there was only him in the room, because they didn't let me stay with him in the room, I understand that we are going through a difficult time, but there are things that don't make sense, anyway, it was after 7:30 am and no one still knew the time of the surgery. in that hospital the worst I've ever been through under the agreement I work in a hospital I know very well how things work and you are one of the worst I've ever seen SUS 10x 0 in you hospital on Avenida Santo Amaro worst of all ugh."

I went to talk to the nurse if she could refer me to the doctor and she told me to my face no, as she was just in pain and there was nothing on her vital signs, which would have to wait. I spoke to the attendant who took her form and again they asked me to wait. Anyway, after an hour I had to go to another hospital, because even the empty ER they wouldn't call the password. And all the time, doctors were walking around talking on their cell phones inside the ER while we waited.Note: The only pain that the nurse said she couldn't do anything about was a kidney infection that took her to the ICU in another hospital. When a patient is admitted reporting that they cannot bear the pain, take it more seriously, as even if there is no change in vital signs, the situation can be critical. No one goes to an emergency room on a whim or because they are feeling great."

However, the space is beautiful and cozy.Service at the table was very good, fast and very attentive.Then the doctors we saw clearly didn't want to be there, terrible service, the first doctor then asked us to wait a little as she was finishing something on WhatsApp...No comments.After medication space and very good service!I recommend the hospital, however, there were two terrible experiences, at the reception and with the doctors, that I couldn't even look in the eye... very bad indeed."
