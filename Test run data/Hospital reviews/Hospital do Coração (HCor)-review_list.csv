I would especially like to thank the team of Dr. Juliana Crosara, Dr. Victor and Dr. Camila for their example of professionalism and humanization! A special thanks also to Dr. Rafael from pneumo and his team. And of course, the nursing team on the sixth floor for their impeccable assistance, especially the nurses Andrea and Monica and the technicians Maria, Andrea and dear Auri from the afternoon shift, a true example of humanization and empathy! I will never forget the care when applying the anticoagulant. Thank you very much!🙏🏾"

So I begin:I'm Rubens Charpinel, I'm 59 years old and by profession I'm an intensive care nurse.I spent my life on the Caring side and we never expected to come to this side: Being taken care of. Precisely on 11/07/2024, I was affected by a large and extensive acute myocardial infarction.Because he was knowledgeable about the situation, he knew that the decision of the place to be treated and the travel time could not be wasted time.My doctor son, my lawyer daughter and my nurse wife decided to bring me to this hospital.HCOR Hospital. A race against Life and Death began. All details needed to be meticulously followed.Upon arriving at the Hospital Entrance, I was promptly welcomed by the HCOR team, together with the Hemodynamicist, immediately sent to the Homodynamics sector, at all conscious moments, I could see on the faces of those who attended to me, the concern to assist me in the most precise and quick of time.Thanks to God and this wonderful team, today I can narrate this situation.Between the First and Second surgery 8 days in hospital. Now, after 10 days of hospitalization, already well recovered, I am awaiting medical discharge.And today I come here to say that the watchword for this Hospital and the entire Team is Only One, Gratitude.Doctors, Nurses, (I can speak with confidence because I am a Nurse) Nursing Technicians, Physiotherapists, Nutritionists, Psychologists, Cleaning, Pharmacy and Pantry staff, I leave you with eternal gratitude.              Because I had an average length of stay, my concern was with the details. And I say: Team HCOR is Homogeneous, Efficient and Humanized. I have always had gratitude in my position in life. Therefore, I use this space here, to thank God, My family, this Hospital and all collaborators without distinction, my Eternal Gratitude 🙏🙏🙏Rubens Lazarine Charpinel"

Rating a thousand for both the Hospital in terms of Technology and the HUMANIZED service provided by all Professionals without exception!! My husband has been admitted to HCOR since 11/07/24. He had a heart attack and needed urgent angioplasty to save his life. Glory to GOD, to the excellent service and agility of the Hemodynamics team, the surgery was a success. On 11/14, he underwent a new angioplasty to place 2 more stents. We praise GOD for my husband's new life. We are eternally grateful to the entire HCOR team, without exception! To Dr. Ricardo, the doctor who performed both procedures. A calm doctor, with vast knowledge who provided complete safety and left us feeling more at ease! To the professionals at UCO (4th floor), All the professionals here on the 10th floor, wonderful, human and charismatic.  To the Copa staff, always with joy and a contagious smile on their faces, not to mention the delicious meals. Lucimara from COPA always serves you with so much care and excellence! I don't know how people complain so much! We are confident that tomorrow will be my husband's discharge. I can say that our experience here in these 10 days has been GREAT.

HCor,"R. Des. Eliseu Guilherme, 147 - Paraíso, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Michele Moraes,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"I don't recommend it. I went to HCor three times. Once in November with a kidney crisis. I was attended to super quickly. They controlled the pain, carried out tests and I was discharged. But I stayed there for more than 9 hours being attended to.The second time now in August also with another kidney crisis. The primary care to control the pain was super quick. However, after the medication, all hell broke loose. The doctor requested surgery to remove the stone and place DuploJ on the same day given the severity of the problem. The hospital claimed it had no vacancy. I spent a night in the ER, in those chairs where you take IV fluids. The next day, only after I went to the hospitalization department to complain did I get a room (around 3pm the next day (something that couldn't even happen since I was in the PS already with hospitalization approved by the plan),The surgery only took place on Thursday afternoon. I was discharged at night.The problem with all this is not just the delay. It is especially the lack of information from the administrative staff - the PS sector did not have updated information on bed management and hospitalization - and these three pieces of information also did not match the fourth one - that of the surgeon's agenda.The third time - I placed the catheter and requested that it be removed 21 days later. I received a response from the hospital with the 'ok' for surgery only the day before at 5pm. Admission should take place at 9am the following day and surgery at 11am. When it was 10:30 am I hadn't even gone up to the room yet - I was in the hospital hall. They claimed they didn't have a bed. I went to the ombudsman's office and magically 2 minutes after my complaint a bed appeared.I went up to the room, my surgery was at 12:30 pm and at 1 pm I was already in the anesthesia recovery department. After being there for 30 minutes, without receiving any information, I questioned them and they claimed that there was no bed to put me in. They didn't have a room. I asked them to call the ombudsman. Nothing. The nurse called another department several times, which insisted on saying that they didn't have any room/bed to put me in. After I threatened to leave, remove some wires and start with a scandal, a bed magically appeared - and amazingly: the same bed I was in before going down for surgery. In other words, I never lost my room, it was always there and the sectors simply didn't know. I still spent 1h15 in the recovery sector before I managed to find a blessed soul to take me to my room. The nurse even suggested anticipating my discharge (which was absurd), since ""there was no room"", which I refused, as I should receive full treatment.In short, the biggest lack of preparation in a hospital I have ever seen in my life. I've been to UBS, which is infinitely better prepared than Hcor.The nurses and doctors were all embarrassed by the disorganization, claiming that this worsening occurred due to the new superior administration. They are polite and try to do their best to assist you. Technically I have nothing to say. They promptly attended to me and treated my pain. However, the lack of care for the patient and companions, lack of internal processes and systems capable of managing the high demand is visible. I will never set foot in this hospital again and I do not recommend it."
HCor,"R. Des. Eliseu Guilherme, 147 - Paraíso, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Maísa Moreno,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",2 months ago,"My daughter was admitted for surgery at the doctor's request through the PS. At the time of admission, he was told that there was no bed available immediately but that between 6pm and 10pm he would go to the room. Under the Sul América agreement, she is entitled to an apartment with a companion.We stayed from approximately 1:30 pm until almost 9:00 pm in chairs in the PS and with no provision for a bed.After discussion with the Admissions supervisor, she was placed on an emergency stretcher and will remain until the surgery, which is initially scheduled for 1pm tomorrow, 18/09, and there is no prediction that she will go to the accommodation to which she is entitled.Just like my daughter, there are other patients waiting more than 24 hours to get a bed according to the supervisor.Where we are, the bathroom is shared, there is no way to shower or do hygiene.We no longer even know if the surgery will take place because HCOR is equated to a public hospital.SUL AMÉRICA SAÚDE take action.Very expensive insurance to go through so much stressI hope everything is resolved before the surgery, otherwise it will be a police matter."

Other hospitals, which are not specialists in cardio, have better protocols, faster care and professionals who are more empathetic and more committed to solving the patient's problem, and not just filling in their personal data in the system. The message that the HCOR emergency room leaves is clear: ""you may arrive at the hospital dying, but before we can treat you, we need to fill in your details in the system. After that, please wait at least another hour to be seen."""

However, today, 7/27/24, my experience was terrible. More than an hour of waiting for a simple pickup. I still had to ""fight"" because the system skipped my password (it went from L1273 to L1275). An employee said she was going to ""see what was going on"" and did not return. On a second attempt, another employee said that ""it was not an error and that I would be called soon"", which happened only after I questioned the delay and without my password appearing on the panel. As if that wasn't enough, I was still made a fool of when I requested the printed invoice. Anyway, if it's up to me, I won't step foot in HCor anymore.

I have everything documented, I have a photo of the exam, because I said I wanted to know later if they were going to do it and charge me, I have the exam from the patient portal, I have the same exam that she sent me with another date that shows the room.I asked if there was anyone else who could assist me and resolve the issue, I was informed that Mr. Ricardo, manager of the HCOR ombudsman's office, was in a meeting and would get back to me.And I still don't have a response from this hospital.I will wait to see what copy and date they will send me with the exam.This is HCOR, where a person from the ombudsman's office can't resolve anything, leads people astray and thinks I'm an alienated person for complaining about an undue charge, because I didn't authorize this exam. Apparently this hospital is in the hands of the clearest ombudsman yet from Mrs Bruna, who treats people with little care, at least me."

I requested that the vein scanner be used if possible, and the nursing assistant informed that it had been a while since they had used it, he didn't even know where it was and he would have to look for it. The nursing assistant, a colleague of that woman, still tried to pierce our daughter and in a failed attempt, he kept moving the needle without removing it (this is a horrible pain and discomfort - I know this because I am a blood and platelet donor) and still left a large bruise on her left arm. They saw that the little girl was extremely angry and crying a lot and went to get help from another professional (who in our opinion should have been sought from the beginning because they couldn't feel our daughter's vein properly). He returned after about 15 minutes with the help of another professional. I insisted once again that I use a vein scanner and was told it was not necessary. I thought... This must be the thing that will solve it. Once again NOTHING and he still insisted on moving the needle without removing it.

The exam would be on the 1/5th around 6am-7am. They directed us to room 71. To our surprise, the toilet was covered in feces, probably from those who prepared for the exam beforehand. I called nurse Alessandra, who visibly embarrassed sent us to room 72 which, surprisingly again, was in the same condition, a toilet dirty with feces. This time she asked someone from cleaning to come and clean it. But we were already very worried about the cleanliness of the room, as it also had a dirty and patched floor and walls, and room 71 also had leaks in the ceiling. Ineligible for a hospital. Nurses Alessandra and Laiza attentive, overcoming discomfort. The exam was at 7 am and everything went well. At 8:30 we were dismissed but the patient still had diarrhea. I asked if there were diapers in the department because from experience with my mother who had the exam at another hospital, she already left with diapers to travel home more comfortably. We went down to the ground floor to try to check if any section of the hospital had diapers. I spoke to employee Matheus, who was very attentive and called the concierge, but unfortunately the hospital does not have adult diapers. I had to go to the pharmacy next door and buy it. Furthermore, we wanted to pay the fee to receive the exam at home since we live far away. But the responsible department only opens at 10 am even with patients undergoing exams at night and early in the morning. I went to the endoscopy reception, accompanied by Matheus, a very attentive employee who did everything he could, but the very rude reception attendant said he couldn't do anything. Very short arm unlike Matheus who is a young boy and due to his competence, he will go far."

After the results came out, it was found that he had a lot of lung secretion and the onset of pneumonia.Well, time passed, I couldn't recover and today (02/18) I went to the PS again.I saw a doctor called Lucas Davi Araujo e Silva who was clearly unwilling to work.He was lethargic, strange…..with bad will…..I wasn't even examined. He didn't get up from his chair.Well, I took the exams and left.I came to the conclusion that the doctors who work there probably don't know how to interpret a CT scan, so I didn't even waste my time.You are clearly only looking for profit.They hire doctors with poor training and no experience.Hcor, without a doubt, has become a 5th category hospital!Even nurses and employees complain.It is regrettable that a hospital that was a reference has declined so much.Don't waste your time trying to go to the ER at this hospital...You can be SURE that the people (simple and humble) who praise and give 5 stars, were used to very bad places, and end up being dazzled by the place..."

Another good surprise: they had options for practically all types of dietary restrictions: zero lactose, Diet hot chocolate, etc. Very tasty snack. I bought my coffee which was also very well taken, of excellent quality.The ONLY thing that left us dissatisfied: the valet service. Not because of the staff who are very attentive, but because of the exorbitant price!! We arrived shortly after 8am and left before 1pm. We paid 79.00!!!I understand that parking in the region is not cheap, but I believe that those who leave their car at the valet and use the hospital's services should have a different price from those who leave their car to visit other establishments in the region (which may happen). But I emphasize that we did not go without knowing. The hospital sent the amounts in advance by email along with the exam information. However, as my husband has reduced mobility, we didn't even have the option of leaving the car in another parking lot.

HCor,"R. Des. Eliseu Guilherme, 147 - Paraíso, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",Maria Cristina Freire,"Rated 1.0 out of 5,",a year ago,"The service at Hospital do Coração was a disappointment, one because I am a patient at the hospital, secondly because I recommended and paid for some exams for a relative of mine (Myocardial Scintigraphy Exam with physical stress and USB of the total abdomen and prostate) The two exams totaled 2,731, 79 (reais and seventy-nine cents, which means a very relevant value in my budget). My attitude, when I requested the quote, was to have excellent service from start to finish. Well, on 04/19/2023 I asked the attendant for a discount, she gave me 10% which would result in 2,458.61 (two thousand, four hundred and fifty-eight reais and sixty-one cents).On the day scheduled for the exam, I gave my daughter my credit card with my password so she could make payment at the time of the exam. Due to forgetfulness, she didn't mention the discount previously granted, but the person who helped me, who unfortunately I don't remember, confirmed to me that he had already given the name of the Patient - Raul Rodrigues de Souza grandson (cardiac) the discount.As she didn't remember, the amount of 2,731.79 was passed, that is, it was paid off at the time of the exam, all of us Brazilians know how these things work, you either pay in advance or don't do it!Approximately 20 days after the examination carried out, the Hospital's ""Finance Department"" began charging weekly charges for the amount above, talking about my debt. My name was sent to a company called C₄- Assessoria em Cobrança, from which I had the displeasure of being charged me and Mr. Raul several times at any time, leaving us in an awkward situation. Me, cardiac, Mr. Raul, cardiac receiving calls from Mrs. Claudia, Mrs. Robério insists and the worst thing is that these creatures seemed to ignore and not hear that the debt had been paid and that it would deserve at least a call to the ""competent"" person responsible by the Financial Department of this well-respected Health Unit such as Hospital do Coração (very popular, by the way) The department together with the so-called Billing Advisory C₄ decided to act together, so I was charged by Mr. André and Mr. João Lucas (both presented themselves as solely responsible for the Department) Between one charge and another I received the following email from the ""Hospital Ombudsman's Office"". —Through the Satisfaction Survey, we received your response regarding the charge for the scintigraphy exam carried out on 04/20/2023.After investigation, we identified that the exam was charged without applying the 10% discount agreed upon at the time of scheduling. We apologize for this error.Our financial team is carrying out the necessary procedures to cancel the note and re-invoice with the appropriate application of the discount. After this process, the discount amount will be refunded.We reiterate our apology and remain available for further clarification.Cordially,Received on 08/16/2023One of the emails I received while the Hcor hospital ombudsman was sending me emails) was from Mr.John Lucas:Mrs. Maria Cristina, good morning!According to the telephone contact, due to the lack of information, we will continue with collection actions.Today until 24:00 will have been 09/05/2023.If the customer who pays deserves this treatment from the Hospital, imagine who doesn't pay?Can I imagine that unsuspecting patients would be treated in the same way?What is the role of the ""Ombudsman""?What ""Finance"" department in a hospital of that size has a finance manager? Or two? Mr. André and Mr. João Lucas?What criteria were used before sending my name and Mr. Raul's name to a collection ""company""?Why didn't the rush to charge me have the fair double hand of reimbursing me for the overpaid amount with interest, the same applied to me?Why is there no rush to reimburse me now?Because now there’s no rush, because now it’s just the customer? Will there be no compensation for the embarrassment we went through?You may have to retake the exams at another health institution, taking into account the service."

It is not enough to advise them to seek public assistance, as the comments will be the same. I have been attending HCor for 7 years, my life is there. Every time I go to a consultation or undergo exams, I pay attention to the behavior of the notable little brothers who, when they leave dissatisfied, not due to the service, but rather due to their own lack of politeness towards others. What is missing is EDUCATION for the ""human being"". The arrogance of some towards the attendants, etc., is surreal. Anyway, it's the ""human being"", isn't it? No, it's not!

I asked him to do it on his left arm, where I always do it and it's easy to access.He couldn't do it, he had to start all over again on his right arm.So I asked why he didn't give me the urine test first, since I would have to go to the bathroom to take a cup of water, hold the pot and get dressed again. All this with arm access! No comments regarding contamination.I still heard from the nurse that it wouldn't be a problem, he would wait to give the medication after collection.I decided to stay quiet and not explain to a nurse the difference between men and women to take such an exam.I'm elderly and obese, he placed the access in my right arm.How can you do all this with a needle stuck in the crook of your arm?Anyway, the staff are kind but extremely misguided."

My son had a fever, body aches, sore throat, lung pain and vomiting, then disappointment came. The doctor on duty just listened to the symptoms we narrated, and didn't even examine the lungs (which would be the basic thing). He only looked at his throat because we asked and he simply informed us that it was normal and gave medicine for the stomach and dipyrone, which he took at the hospital itself and tested for COVID and nothing else, he didn't even ask for an X-ray/CT scan, sending my son home.*To take it at home, he prescribed anti-allergy and dipyrone and nothing helped.*Another neglect began. COVID TESTING. 48 hours for the result to come out, absurd, after all the situation was favorable for Covid and we were inside an HCor.*ERROR IN DIAGNOSIS.*On 02/27/23, the condition worsened beyond the symptoms that he had already presented on the 25th, high fever, shortness of breath, closing of the throat with a lot of pain to the point of being unable to drink water and swallow saliva and as a result of poor service, we decided to look for another hospital, in this case SÃO LUIZ, Anália Franco, where we were very well looked after. My son was examined properly, they checked his throat, lungs, heart, blood tests and other physical exams and as his lung was compromised and he had a cough, as he was before, he requested a CT scan, where PNEUMONIA was detected, he was immediately admitted to the ICU for 5 days and was almost intubated and during this interval COVID was detected.*Much of this situation could have been avoided if the doctor had taken care to carry out a more thorough examination and ordered some tests.*Years ago, I used HCor's services several times, it was a reference, it lived up to its name and reputation, but now, I'm very sad at what it has become.*I tell this story so that it doesn't happen to other people, what happened to us."

But hcor has all this and much more. My son Bernardo had heart surgery on January 27th and is still in the cardiopediatric ICU. And we are receiving all the necessary support. However, I would like to praise all the professionals who serve us, as they are extremely careful and humane. Today I came to highlight all the affection and support I have been receiving from receptionist Ingrid Taylane. She always receives me a lot of affection and empathy, she has welcomed me on the saddest days here in this ICU, listening and supporting me. There are days when I'm destroyed that my son is still in this ICU, but she manages to cheer me up, with all her empathy and love. Hcor is a reference and is an excellent hospital, but not only because of the structure and medical team, people like Ingrid are essential for it to continue being what it is.I still need to continue, talking about the nursing team which is simply WONDERFUL, skilled and humane nurses and technicians, among them all, I would like to highlight technician Ana Paula de Sá Correa, from the morning shift, a short blonde with a giant heart, who She takes care of my child as if it were her own, I have never seen or felt so much love emanating from a human being. I also want to praise the techniques Natália (loving and cheerful, always distracts me), Sandra (a mother who shows a lot of skill and knowledge, gives us security) Maria Inês (gives me a lot of security and reassures me) Liliane (human professional and very skilled in Take care of my son, it feels incredibly reassuring to see her taking care of my baby) Valéria (always attentive and concerned about distracting us on sadder days) Adriana (excellent professional, competence and skills who reassure us) Regis (always attentive to my son, concerned about his well-being, even in the face of all the setbacks), Beatriz (very technical and skilled in caring for my son).I have no words for the nurses, Elisa, Graça, Giovana and Adriana are excellent professionals, they always answered my doubts and welcomed me in the most difficult moments. Their technical knowledge is impressive, in addition to the human care that was never lacking.Physio Kety is simply wonderful, and even though her work, for us mothers, is horrible, she takes a lot of care and love so that my son doesn't feel so much discomfort, she's not just worried about doing her job, she cares about the baby's well-being, and takes as long as it takes to deliver a quality service.Finally, I would like to thank all the professionals who have done everything for me and my son."

As we live in Santos, we left home at 3:30 am, fasting, checked into the hospital and waited like idiots in the lobby to call us to the room. After taking a position, we were informed that the surgery would be at 11:00 am, that we should have been admitted at 9:00 am, and that we would have to wait for up to 6 hours in the lobby to be able to go up to the room.

I arrived at reception and was told that because I was late (even though I arrived on time) I would have to wait for other patients to pass in front of me. I waited more than an hour and, even so, people continued to pass by who had clearly arrived after me.The girls said they would give priority, but the biomedical doctor still said they should wait.It's a total lack of professionalism.

I understand that older people are part of the team and I think this inclusion is great, but better training is needed. The lady at reception was on her cell phone when we arrived at 6:20 in the morning. I don't think I have to wait for her to finish checking her social media to answer me and insist that the exam isn't in that block. If it weren't for my insistence, she would have made us go home!!! Afterwards, the customer service lady took forever to open the form because she was having a parallel conversation with her tablemate talking about the cold weather and breakfast. Either answer us or talk. Either way, it gets boring and time-consuming. Finally, the coffee man. A brute, poorly educated, unwilling to meet the demands of the schedule. Distracting people waiting for service and their co-workers with their impatience.It’s easy to see that we have 2 different worlds in the same hospital. Spectacular service from employees in general, but that falls apart due to 3 or 4 who are obsolete in education and goodwill. Are they just there to work hours to retire or for some reason are they immune to training and education because of their age?I'm complaining because I like the hospital, I'm there every week, but I don't have to put up with the ill will of 2 or 3.

The doctors are very clear, objective and answer all doubts.The snack served is very good and absolutely nothing is missing.The facilities are new and everything is very clean.The only downside was the delay in care, but unfortunately there were much worse cases than mine - I had a migraine, and the others were more serious, so thinking from that side I understood.The valet is also quite expensive, as we arrived at 11:04 and left at 16:34 the cost was 75.00.Anyway, I had more positive points than negatives because lately some hospitals have been lacking in terms of service, which is not the case with HCOR.Be patient, because although it is not being reported, many people have suffered a lot due to post-COVID and the consequences were not few and I could see that the vast majority of people in front of me werefrom that. HCOR, I hope you continue with this service as I felt very welcomed and detailed, by absolutely everyone, without exception. Continue investing in training because it has given results. ;-)"

Then I saw an opportunity in communicating with a network of this size.After completing this procedure, I received the news that I would have to operate, the PS doctor advised me to arrive at the hospital on 10/05 at 8 am, and he would request emergency surgery, already agreed with the doctor who would perform the surgery, all very transparent and in front of me, I only went to the room at 3 pm, I had no information about the time of my surgery, I just knew it would be on 11/05.18:30 on the 10th I found out that the fast would start at 00:00, but without information on the surgery time, at 20:30 the anesthetist came to my room to ask questions and such and informed that the surgery would be at 7:00 , they woke me up at 5 am, I took a shower, and I only went down to the surgery at 10 am, after asking several times!While I was in the pre-operative room I stayed for another 40 minutes.The lack of information and the lack of information created a terrible experience for me, especially because it was my first surgery.

We've been here at HCOR since 11 pm. We arrived in an urgent situation. In emergencies, the gate is closed with a yellow bar, preventing entry, and only one valet at the cashier is busy. A driverless car in front of us. At first, at the hospital, we were well looked after, but Dr Natalia Melo said we couldn't leave, that my husband's case was probably surgical. She said we should stay, that she would arrange hospitalization. We sat in an uncomfortable chair for three hours, without anyone coming to explain. Three hours later I went to ask what time he would be going to his room, when the nursing technician (who was doing nothing but talking to her colleague) told me that we would probably be sitting in the chair all day because the hospital is full. I completely understand the hospital being full. But I don't understand anyone telling us the number of hours we would have to wait, a whole day. Nor did they offer to open the reclining chair, to make the “stay” a little more comfortable. Not even offered a blanket. No empathy. No kindness. No reception. Two rude people. Terrible service that is making me rethink whether it is worth paying so much for Amil to have this type of service. The attitude of the nursing technicians, Daniele Santos (I think, because she didn't want to tell me her name) and Ana Cleide, was inhumane and mocking. There was not a minimum of consideration on the part of doctor Natalia Melo, who until now has not returned to speak to us and has not ordered the medicines that are important for my husband's health and which appear in his medical records at this hospital, as he always comes here. Dr André Mello said he said he would help but did nothing."

Although wearing masks, I believe that such proximity suggests the use of a face shield; would protect the patient and the nurse. Without such protection, your eyes are exposed to receiving particles from one person's exhalation, and particles may be inhaled when using a low-efficiency mask. Ultimately, I believe it is appropriate to provide and recommend that nurses use a face shield for the aforementioned activity."

However, an alert needs to be sent to the Hcor management, carry out a screening when choosing doctors for the PS, first aid is extremely important so that a patient is not discharged by mistake. I can say this because I was on 2/8/21 at 9:30 pm with vomiting, diarrhea and sweating, although I was attended to immediately because it was empty, but I was helped by the nurses, I even fainted, the doctor on duty didn't even come close to me, stood between the door and said that the nurses would do my blood tests and an abdominal tomography, from the blood test to the CT it took 2 hours, in the meantime I had access to the vein but without serum, I did the CT, I took serum and medications, I informed her that I was a patient of the Doctors I mentioned previously, but she said that I was fine, that it was probably a digestive upset, I was discharged in the morning on 8/3/21 at 8:30 am, the first doctor Natalia de Melo Pereira, who had attended to me in the PS, had already passed the shift to Dr Alexia Hallack Dreicon, who at dawn handed the shift to Dr André Mello Gerhadt, this third party was attentive and He informed my gastroenterologist Dr Mounib Tacla that I was in the ER, passing on to him the word of the 2 doctors who attended to me, saying that the tests were good, I am medicated but without significant improvements, so today I logged in for the tests and found out that I have very high leukocytes, high. I sent my exams to Dr Tacla and just like me, he received the information from the PS, but given the results of the exams he told me to go to his office tomorrow morning.Conclusion; A top-notch hospital cannot fail with a PS of recent graduates or young people who are uninterested in the patient. I sincerely hope that this statement of mine serves as a warning."

Who knows, maybe if I wait, I'll get substantially worse, but HCor doesn't give a damn about that.

So as not to cause us any more worry. He spent the rest of the day crying, scared. We were shocked by this neglect. This lack of respect in this fragile and vulnerable moment. Honestly..... Reaching the age of 90, paying a fortune for health insurance, choosing a first-rate hospital and having to go through this type of humiliation and abuse. We will report to the ombudsman in the future. But for now, here's a tip. In this time of pandemic, more than ever, take care and protect yours."

My husband was already feeling better from his dizziness, but he ended up getting nervous because the place to take his medication was busy and it also took a long time to respond. We ended up going home because we couldn't stay in an emergency room for more than 3 hours for a simple consultation and medication. This service needs to be improved urgently!"

During the consultation, the doctor on duty requested blood tests (it was found that urea and creatinine were high, signaling chronic renal failure). Regarding pain in the abdomen, the doctor recommended an abdominal and pelvic tomography. And that's where my dissatisfaction and complaints come in. The doctor who performed the tomography at 9:21 pm (04/07), Dr. Guilherme Curcio Félix Louza, CRM 202220, did not find any important evidence, which caused me a lot of concern, due to the severe pain reported by the patient. After waiting 3 hours and reading the report, I preferred to seek help at another hospital, as I disbelieved the result. So much pain and no change? In HCor, an inflammation/infection in the bowel loop, which was causing the referred pain, was not detected in the tomography examination; in addition to other changes (gastric hernia, chronic nephropathy, which explains the renal failure), evidence that was found by the team at Hospital Benciência Portuguesa, which in turn, also did not agree with the HCor report due to the patient's symptoms conflicting with the result of taking HCor. Therefore, the doctor on duty at Benciência Portuguesa re-performed the examination (tomography of the abdomen and pelvis) at 02:24 on 07/05, where the patient was subsequently admitted.On Monday, 07/06/20, I contacted the person responsible for PS HCor contesting the report of this tomography, Katia Simone Vianna, PS service supervisor and as it was private, I requested its exclusion for divergence of results.Today, 13/07, the HCor Ombudsman's Office denied my request, claiming that the medical team met and that there was nothing wrong with the report and that they will not exclude me from the service, even after I have explained the reason for the Rodrigo, head of the radiology department at HCor. I reported it to the CRM to seek help and guidance, as in my opinion, the tomography report was deficient; The doctor was unable to detect several pre-existing changes, which delayed my grandmother's diagnosis and consequently her hospitalization, as all the BP tests had to be re-done.I am very dissatisfied with the refusal I received from HCor to defend themselves and say that there was no mistake on the part of the doctor. They think they hold the truth, they never make mistakes or are never mistaken. This superiority makes us feel mediocre and defenseless. If I hadn't taken my grandmother to another hospital, perhaps she wouldn't be among us, because thanks to BP's conduct, she left the ICU and is now at home; which makes me believe that the conduct, report and diagnoses were correct, as today she is stable and pain-free.I'm giving 01 star, as there is no zero option."

HCor,"R. Des. Eliseu Guilherme, 147 - Paraíso, São Paulo - SP, Brazil",P_Luiz L,"Rated 4.0 out of 5,",5 years ago,"When I saw that an evaluation only complained about the content of a television channel, during the wait, I realized that the most relevant thing was NOT mentioned negatively, which is reception, medical care and medication. In other words, a good sign, but in my opinion, this ""REASON"" will never justify the evaluation expected of the place. In addition to the good average rating, I know of this Hospital's reference for having already done a treadmill exam with double monitoring, that is, from a technician and a doctor who I think is essential in this type of exam, neglected in other places, where the presence It's just for the technician.  MY review is with the first time I used the PS this past Saturday 10/19/19.  It lasted 2 hours to complete the cycle of receiving medical care, x-ray examination and medication. I believe this time can be improved, although the difficulty in evaluating is due to the peak demand and time of day. I entered at 11:40, left at 1:40. There were quite a few patients. But the staff are attentive, they DO NOT leave anything to be desired. The exam, ok nothing to mention. Medication also ok. Good orthopedic medical care. The complaint is the responsibility of the prescription.  The anti-inflammatory Toragesic 10mg comes with 10 tablets to last exactly 5 days of treatment. However, Coltrax 04mg comes with 20 tablets. Since the dose is 12h/12h, there would be 10 tablets left (HALF!). Doing some research, I discovered that there is an injectable option that could be prescribed proportional to the days. With all RESPECT to the Doctor, I cannot help but DISAGREE with this prescription, since it does not make sense to purchase a medicine and end up having a relevant amount left over, which is not economically viable for the patient's pocket. Considering that there is no cheap medication, not even generics have affordable prices as expected. And I consider it a very relevant vision on the part of the doctor, that is, treating the patient with EMPATHY. He missed so much that he had to ask me to take the hospital medication. In other places, the doctor automatically refers or at least asks if the patient wants to take the medication. I think it's obvious yes, as the patient needs prior treatment before acquiring the prescribed medication. In short, I am doing PARTIAL treatment. For the reason explained, I only bought Toragesic. Well, this is my comment about my experience and the justification for the rating."

I've already used the service in 2 specialties and I didn't like the service. But what is really bad and needs to improve is the P.S. Last week I had to use it. It didn't take long to go through the screening because there weren't many people to be served, but after the screening I was waiting 50 minutes and hadn't been called yet. by reception. I went to the counter and asked about the delay because they weren't helping anyone, it was full of attendants talking to each other and typing on their cell phones. They said it was next. I waited another 15 minutes and no call. I went back to the counter, where a reception employee with long dark hair, light brunette, and very exuberant makeup was talking to the girl at the screening desk. I got closer but they continued talking. As I continued standing there in front of the counter, the girl at reception got angry and asked what I was doing there, if I had been called by any chance, I said no. I just asked for my documents and left there. I went to the Emergency Room at Raimundo Vasconcelos Hospital and received much better care!"

The wait was 2 and a half hours, for a doctor who didn't even look at the patient, didn't make the slightest effort to see what the problem was.There is a reversal in the roles of receptionist and triage, first you go through the triage, and only then do you find out if your plan is covered by the hospital, this is very strange. Besides, it took 30 minutes to be seen at the triage (the emergency room was empty, so much so that the panel showed the number before mine), after being seen at the triage, another 30 minutes the receptionist attended to me, after I signed all the papers, She looks at me with a ""look, I forgot to say"" face, the wait is 2 hours because we only have 1 orthopedist, which she should have warned us from the beginning, besides she blamed the lack of warning on the triage nurse .In short, the hospital is doing a terrible job, I spent 5 hours in the hospital just to waste my time, as it wasn't of much help, lack of professionalism.Not to mention that the hospital needs maintenance, the chairs are very old in terms of receiving medicines (torn), and in this room the air conditioning had a super low temperature, extremely unpleasant, especially since the nurses take forever to take the medicine, and they make you change places all the time.The hospital was much better."
